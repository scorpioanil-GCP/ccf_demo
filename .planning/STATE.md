  2026-08-21 -- **PHASE 20 EXECUTION COMPLETE ON `phase-20`. AWAITING THE SS3.1 CLOSE PANEL
  AND `D-GATE-20`.** 8 plans / 8 serial waves / 25 tasks, `9e4bd0e`..`d9b3f5a`. THE CLAIM IS
  MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED: `consume.py` and three foreign-harness clients -- Google ADK, the
  Anthropic Agent SDK, LangGraph -- each print the SAME content address
  `5d7bfa49f5b3f65add25ea61220a191a91982f5ae97901e010b26c5ca8dc37f5`, each carrying the
  declared payload names, in 10.5s with NO live model call. CLAUDE.md SS7.3's "a harness
  that already speaks MCP needs no adapter for consumption" is now DEMONSTRATED against the
  current surface. Clients import harness + `mcp` + stdlib ONLY -- AST-verified by the
  orchestrator and gated by `test_client_example_purity.py` per-root permitted sets with
  `ccf` refused BY NAME. `CLNT-23..32` minted and discharged (TEN rows). `D-IMPL-163..169`.
  **DAVE RULED TWICE IN-FLIGHT.** (1) The WAVE-1 LAYOUT BLOCKER: `test_artifact_schema_headers.py`
  enforces a bijection -- every `examples/**/artifacts/` must sit under a directory containing
  `run.py` -- and `H-11` forbids a `run.py` at the example root, so an `artifacts/` dir there is
  ORPHANED BY CONSTRUCTION, and naming the runner `run.py` would make `runner/` a SECOND root
  demanding its own `artifacts/`. Ruled: both the declared input and the runner live in
  `runner/`, and the runner is `drive.py`. Plan repair across six plans, `dc2c214`.
  (2) **RULING 6**: the leg-2 prompt is DATA, and `cinv01a-prompt-shape` is TIGHTENED IN-PHASE
  (scope deliberately widened, recorded in the ROADMAP as ruling 6, `b4217e9`). The measured
  hole: `prompt_score` scores short realistic agent prompts 0-1 against `PROMPT_SCORE_THRESHOLD = 2`,
  so a hardcoded system instruction in an example client produced NO finding. Lowering the
  threshold to 1 was measured at 94 FALSE findings and STILL missed two of four shapes; the
  adopted fix is a DESTINATION ARM -- refuse prose that REACHES a model-instruction sink,
  following the value through local bindings and `os.environ.get` fallbacks. It surfaced TWO
  GENUINE pre-existing SS6.4 violations in `examples/external/00-hello-context/`, both
  remediated in-phase.
  **FOUR CHECKS THAT COULD NOT FAIL WERE FOUND AND CLOSED, THREE OF THEM BY THE EXECUTORS
  THEMSELVES.** (a) wave 5: `socket.create_connection` control passed with its patch REMOVED,
  because CPython's `create_connection` calls the OTHER patched name -- retargeted at an
  unresolvable `.invalid` host, upgrading the claim to "not even a name lookup". (b) wave 6:
  two control branches unreachable because a broader check fired first. (c) wave 7: a vacuous
  pass over a missing subject left two controls green. (d) wave 8: CONTROL 6 caught that a
  BROKEN `git diff` and a CLEAN one are indistinguishable -- without it the phase would have
  closed on two green emptiness assertions over a comparison that never ran.
  **ONE GUARD WAS NARROWED AND THE ORCHESTRATOR SENT IT BACK.** Wave 7 narrowed ext-00's
  `git status --porcelain` guard to untracked-files-only, justified by a red it saw during its
  own task. Measured post-commit: the verbatim form PASSES; commit-before-verify was the
  available remedy. Both arms restored over one `porcelain_entries` read, eight controls,
  twelve mutations all red. `D-IMPL-166` sets the general rule: A GUARD IS NEVER NARROWED TO
  ACCOMMODATE AN AUTHOR'S IN-FLIGHT WORKING TREE.
  GATE: `make ci` EXIT 0 -- **4083 passed / 118 skipped**, 406 lint, 154 docs. Tests
  4013 -> 4083 (+70). `examples/s2-01-external-consumers/` MOVED to
  `docs/retired/16-external-consumers/` with history; `examples/external/00-hello-context/`
  KEPT and marked historical IN PROSE under an existing heading (its `run.py` enforces seven
  `## ` headings by name and order). CRITERION 7 ASSERTED: `git diff 9e4bd0e..HEAD -- src/`
  EMPTY, with CONTROL 6/7 proving the assertion is not vacuous.

  PHASE 20 IS EXECUTION-COMPLETE AND NOT YET GATED. Work is on branch `phase-20`
  (`9e4bd0e`..`5c0cc24`), NOT on `main`. NEXT ACTION, per CLAUDE.md SS3.1 and in this order:
  (1) the CROSS-AI PANEL against the SHIPPED CODE -- `/gsd-review --phase "Phase 20" --all`
  -- written to a DISTINCT `20-CLOSE-REVIEWS.md` so the pre-execution plan reviews survive;
  (2) the single-agent code review, which is ADDITIVE and never a substitute; (3) VERIFY
  EVERY FINDING against the tree before recording or acting on it, and record rejected
  findings as rejected; (4) fix all blocking findings IN-PHASE; (5) present to Dave with the
  triage; (6) `D-GATE-20` and the merge to `main`.
  TWO RESIDUALS ARE CARRIED, NEITHER PAPERED OVER. (1) THE POST-SUMMARY REGENERATION WINDOW:
  GSD writes a plan's SUMMARY AFTER its tasks, so a final `tools/retirement_sweep.py --report`
  can be invalidated by that plan's own summary naming a retiring path. Measured at wave 8 --
  it added EXACTLY ONE row and skipping the step would have left `make ci` RED on a tree
  nobody else had touched. It is a HAND-RUN STEP, NOT A MECHANISM: the next phase's first
  plan must repeat it if it edits `.planning/**` before asserting `make ci`. The currency test
  was NOT exempted; if the hand-run proves insufficient that is a `D-IMPL` and a STOP.
  (2) The x86_64 `claude-agent-sdk==0.2.128` wheel bundling the `claude` CLI is UNVERIFIED
  from this aarch64 host. NO FALLBACK WAS BUILT and none should be -- a second leg-2 path CI
  never exercises is criterion 6's own failure mode. Confirm with one CI run or
  `pip download claude-agent-sdk==0.2.128 --platform manylinux_2_17_x86_64 --no-deps` and
  inspect the wheel for `_bundled/claude`. The README states the wheel bundles the CLI without
  qualifying by architecture; that is the sentence to correct if it resolves against us.
  **WHAT WAS ACTUALLY VERIFIED AT CLOSE, AND BY WHOM -- DO NOT RE-DERIVE, DO NOT OVERCLAIM.**
  The executor ran a FULL `make ci` to EXIT 0 at `d9b3f5a`: **4083 passed / 118 skipped**,
  406 lint, 154 docs. The ORCHESTRATOR verified, at HEAD, independently: `make gate-tools`
  EXIT 0 (406 + 154); `tests/examples` **456 passed / 37 skipped**; criterion 7 (`git diff
  9e4bd0e..HEAD -- src/` EMPTY); `s2-01` gone with exactly ONE `client_langgraph.py` under
  `examples/`; ten `CLNT-23..32` rows flipped; the ten Success Criteria still parsing as TEN
  after the ROADMAP hand-edit; and a live `make example-hw1-harness-clients` printing three
  legs plus the reference at one address with declared names and NO refusal line. THE
  ORCHESTRATOR DID NOT COMPLETE A FULL `make ci` ITSELF -- see the harness note below. The
  delta between the executor's green run and HEAD is ONLY `.planning/ROADMAP.md`,
  `.planning/STATE.md` and the regenerated inventory, and NO test under `tests/` reads
  `ROADMAP.md` or `STATE.md` (measured), so the untested surface is nil.
  **HARNESS LIMITATION, OPERATIONAL:** a full `make ci` CANNOT be completed in one tool call
  in this environment -- foreground Bash caps at 10 minutes and background jobs were KILLED
  at ~3 minutes, twice. A partial run reached lint OK, typecheck OK, suite 34% with ZERO
  failures before external `Terminated` (NOT a test failure). Do not read that termination as
  a red build. To verify the full suite, either run it OUTSIDE the agent harness, or run the
  components separately (`make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test`, `make examples`,
  `make docs-strict`, `make gate-tools`). Also: NEVER pipe a long build through `tail` in a
  background job -- `tail` buffers until EOF, so a kill leaves an EMPTY log. Redirect to a
  file and read the file.
  **HOW TO BRIEF THE CLOSE PANEL.** Review the SHIPPED CODE, not the plans -- the plans
  already had FOUR review rounds (11 -> 7 -> 4 -> 0 findings) and those decisions are
  executed. Give the panel the findings ALREADY KNOWN and tell it NOT to re-derive them; its
  budget is better spent on what is ADJACENT. This phase's defect classes, for aiming it:
  (a) CHECKS THAT COULD NOT FAIL -- four found and closed, three by the executors sabotaging
  their own controls; (b) A GUARD NARROWED FOR A TRANSIENT REASON (`D-IMPL-166`); (c) GATES
  NOBODY CONSULTED -- the wave-1 `artifacts/` bijection and a docstring path silently
  acquiring a coupling row. REVIEWER RELIABILITY ON THIS HOST: `codex` has reviewed NOTHING
  at exit 0 when its sandbox fails -- inline the source for it and check it actually read
  something; `gemini` has FABRICATED symbols. Verify EVERY finding against the tree with a
  `path:line` before recording it, and record rejected findings AS REJECTED.

# STATE — CCF SDK

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Whitepaper fidelity — every load-bearing primitive in
`docs/CCF_Whitepaper_1-2.md` realized in code with its contracts, invariants,
and composition properties. Priority order: fidelity → general-purposeness →
harness neutrality → adoptability. `/home/parkave/ccf_code/CLAUDE.md` (rev 4)
is canonical for phases, review protocol, invariants, and decision log.

**Current focus:** **PHASE 19 — The Client-Seam Integrity Checks Must Be Able to
Fail.** Phase 18.1 is COMPLETE and GATED (`D-GATE-18.1`, Dave, 2026-08-19).
Phase 19 is DISCUSSED (`19-CONTEXT.md`, 14 decisions) but NOT PLANNED. Phase 18 is
complete; its focus text is preserved below for continuity.

**Prior focus (Phase 18):** **MCP Transport: the second door and the
portability proof.** Opened 2026-08-17 by `D-IMPL-147` (Dave), on branch
`phase-18`. One plan, four tasks, ready to execute; nothing part-done.
**Read `.planning/HANDOFF-2026-08-17.md` for the cold-start picture** — it is
accurate on everything except its "RESUME HERE" section, which said the next
phase was undefined; it now is. That handoff supersedes
`HANDOFF-2026-08-16.md`, which carries a SUPERSEDED banner.

The design of record is unchanged and this phase adds none:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-ccf-client-design.md` plus its Amendment 1 —
specifically §6 (*"an adapter is official when it passes"*), §9 (the sync-only
ruling, whose named revisit trigger **is this adapter**), and Amendment 1 §A
(the `D-28` rollout: *"the MCP door is fixed to produce it in this phase"*).
The pause spec
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-16-reference-plan-factory-and-debt-scorer.md`
plus Amendment A) is DISCHARGED.

**Why this phase and not another:** the conformance suite was already written to
take a second subject and says so in its own docstring, and a single adapter
cannot falsify a claim about adapters — the cross-adapter comparisons currently
degenerate to self-comparisons. The three rejected candidates and their reasons
are in `D-IMPL-147`.

## Current Position

Phase: **20 — Client Access from Three Harnesses (ADK, Anthropic Agent SDK, LangGraph)**
  ADDED 2026-08-20 (Dave, `/gsd-phase`). **SCOPE CONFIRMED AND ALL FOUR OPEN QUESTIONS
  RULED, 2026-08-20 — NOT YET DISCUSSED, NOT PLANNED.** Ten Success Criteria are in the
  ROADMAP entry already, per `D-GATE-19`'s forward-binding ruling, and Dave ruled they are
  **the gate target and are NOT to be expanded during planning**.
  RULINGS (all four, locked before planning, recorded in the ROADMAP entry):
  (1) **CI determinism — adopt the `examples/external/00-hello-context` replay pattern.**
  Seed or replay so all three legs are CI-GREEN BY DEFAULT, `--live` opt-in for a real
  populated deployment. **"Unrun" is REJECTED** (CLAUDE.md §9). **A live populated
  deployment must NOT be a CI requirement.** This is the load-bearing one; the rest are
  layout and hygiene. (2) **One directory, three clients** —
  `examples/hw1-harness-clients/` or similar, exact name settled at discuss, ONE README
  stating the frame. (3) **Duplicates** — the Phase 16 orphans in
  `examples/s2-01-external-consumers/` are quarantined or removed (no runner, no README,
  no `make` target); the Phase 13.1 clients under `examples/external/00-hello-context/`
  stay as historical externals OR are clearly marked pre-Phase-17 surface; **Phase 20's
  trio is canonical going forward.** (4) **Requirement lane — continue `CLNT-NN`**, no new
  prefix.
  (5) **The replay harness is COPIED into the new directory, NOT SHARED with
  `examples/external/00-hello-context/`** (Dave, 2026-08-20, answering the residual point
  that rulings 1 and 3 touch the same file — Phase 20 inherits the RUNNER DESIGN, replay
  by default with `--live` opt-in, not a shared implementation contract with a
  retired-vintage example). Coupling a canonical example to one just marked historical
  means a change for either risks breaking the other, and **Phase 20 must not break when
  `00-hello-context` ages out or is quarantined**. Duplicating a small harness is cheap;
  shared ownership across "canonical now" and "historical" is not. `00-hello-context`
  keeps its own copy. SETTLED for discuss unless a strong counter-measurement appears.
  Next action: `/gsd:discuss-phase 20`, proceeding AGAINST these rulings rather than
  re-opening them. If any ruling turns out to affect SDK surface rather than example
  layout, that is a `D-IMPL-NN` and a STOP, not a quiet widening.

Phase: **19 — The Client-Seam Integrity Checks Must Be Able to Fail (INSERTED).**
  **EXECUTING** — started 2026-08-19 from `0fe0a22` on `main`. 8 plans in 6 waves.
  NO PHASE BRANCH: Dave ruled on 2026-08-19 that the work lands directly on `main`,
  as Phases 18 and 18.1 did — there are no SDK consumers, so `main` carrying un-gated
  phase work costs nothing, and history still permits carving a branch retroactively.
  Wave plan: 1 `19-01` -> 2 `19-02` -> 3 `19-04`+`19-05`+`19-06` (parallel, worktrees)
  -> 4 `19-03` -> 5 `19-07` -> 6 `19-08`. Only wave 3 uses worktree isolation; `19-08`
  edits `.planning/ROADMAP.md` and MUST stay on the main tree because the worktree
  cleanup path backs up and restores tracking files across the merge.
  `state.begin-phase` TRUNCATED THIS FILE 1046 -> 661 LINES at phase start
  (`D-IMPL-154`/`155` class, fourth distinct handler). Backed up, diffed, restored,
  hand-edited. Its counters were again structurally impossible (173 total / 184 done).

Phase: **18.1 — Simplify the MCP Example: Client-Side Access, Server Off-Stage.**
  INSERTED 2026-08-18 (Dave). **COMPLETE AND GATED — `D-GATE-18.1` APPROVED
  (Dave, 2026-08-19).** 5/5 plans plus a close-fix set; 3 blocking findings found
  by the panel and fixed in-phase, each independently re-sabotaged. `make ci-core`
  exit 0 at `04cccc2`, 3909/118/0. No merge required — the work landed on `main`. ROADMAP entry, Phases-list bullet and progress row all written
  BY HAND — `phase.insert` produced only a stub detail section, and no `state.*` or
  `roadmap.*` SDK writer has been run against either file.
  **A CLIENT-EXPERIENCE PHASE THAT SHIPS NO NEW SDK SURFACE.** Three changes:
  `CCF_BINDING` names a DEPLOYMENT rather than a script (server command declared in
  `binding.yaml` as data), `server/serve.py` is cut to a readable length into a second
  `server/` module, and the README states the frame — THE SAME CONTEXT PRODUCT REACHED
  A DIFFERENT WAY, why a server appears at all (the first example ran in-process and
  produced the product directly), and that HOW THE SERVER IS ASSEMBLED IS DELIBERATELY
  OUT OF SCOPE until the Context Product assembly examples.
  THE FINDING: the spawn itself is inherent to MCP stdio and is NOT the defect; the
  defect is that it is the client's business in the reader's field of view.
  WITHDRAWN SAME-DAY: an earlier draft shipping `mcp+http` as a third adapter — SDK
  transport work inside a deliberately client-side phase, which Phase 19 would have
  rewritten. Independent of Phase 19 either way.
  **DISCUSSED 2026-08-18** — `18.1-CONTEXT.md` + `18.1-DISCUSSION-LOG.md` committed at
  `60f2bd3` on `main`; no phase branch, no plan, nothing executed. Seventeen decisions
  (`D-01`..`D-17`) plus one documentation constraint `C-1`.
  **ONE MORNING RULING WAS REOPENED BY DAVE AND REVERSED:** the server does **NOT** move
  into the deployment root. `server/` STAYS A SIBLING of `deployment/` at the example top
  level, and `binding.yaml`'s `server:` key resolves against the deployment root's
  **parent** — no `..`, absolute paths and symlink escapes still refused, so containment is
  enforced against a declared base rather than holed. Consequence: **`D-IMPL-141` A.3 needs
  no amendment and `assert_one_python_module` needs no rewrite** — both drop out of the
  phase, which is strictly less mechanism than the reversed ruling. Dave's reason:
  *"Server is temporary in this specific example because it is not the focus"*, and in
  practice a server is on another machine.
  **`C-1`, A CONSTRAINT ON THE WRITING:** *"Make sure not to generalize the documentation
  that servers will always be in deployment — they will not."* A sentence implying
  otherwise is a defect in this phase's own terms, in the README, `binding.yaml`'s header
  and `serve.py`'s docstring alike.
  Also settled: one-token `mcp+stdio:<root>` address with a named migration branch for the
  old two-token form and a targeted refusal when the token is a file; the adapter (not the
  loader) refuses a missing `server:` key, because the loader cannot know which transport
  is asking; `serve.py` keeps the door and a second `server/` module takes the composition;
  **no line budget** — the criterion is structural, one file one concern; the README's
  obsolete two-token paragraph is deleted for one sentence on the one-word difference.
  DEFERRED to the assembly examples: Dave's `client/` + `server/` top-level restructure.
  **PLANNED 2026-08-18.** Five plans, five waves, deliberately linear:
  `18.1-01` clears the pre-existing red and lands `server:` as a contained data key;
  `18.1-02` flips the grammar to one token across every site IN ONE COMMIT (the
  README↔Makefile character-identity gate forces it) and adds the four refusal controls;
  `18.1-03` cuts `serve.py` into `server/compose.py`; `18.1-04` writes the README frame,
  the surface fragment and the `D-IMPL-153` entry, and carries the `C-1`
  **`checkpoint:human-verify`** (`autonomous: false`); `18.1-05` re-sweeps after the last
  SUMMARY.
  **TWO RULINGS TAKEN AT PLANNING, `D-18` AND `D-19`** — see `18.1-CONTEXT.md`. `D-18`
  means **THE PHASE NO LONGER SHIPS ZERO NEW SDK SURFACE**: it ships ~4 lines of it on
  purpose, and the ROADMAP sentence plus the surface fragment must say so or a reviewer
  reads it as scope creep.
  **KNOWN AND DISPOSITIONED, NOT TO BE REDISCOVERED:** `make ci-core` is knowingly red
  from `18.1-03` to `18.1-05` (the `D-13` docstring trim moves the `serve.py:68` coupling
  row), and `test_the_committed_report_is_current` may also go stale on planning-tree rows
  THIS PHASE'S OWN SUMMARYs add. Both plans carry the diff-classification procedure: every
  changed row must be a `.planning/phases/18.1-*` row, anything else is a real regression.
  **TWO SUCCESS CRITERIA ARE REVIEW-ONLY, BY DESIGN:** `C-1` (documentation must not
  generalize that servers live in the deployment) and "is `serve.py` readable now" —
  `D-12` declines a line budget on purpose, and ~30% of that file is prose about itself,
  which moving composition out cannot shrink. Neither is machine-checkable and no proxy
  gate was invented for them.
  Next action: `/clear` then `/gsd:execute-phase 18.1`.

Phase: **19 — The Client-Seam Integrity Checks Must Be Able to Fail.** DISCUSSED,
  NOT PLANNED. `19-CONTEXT.md` + `19-DISCUSSION-LOG.md` committed at `90f9822` on
  `main`; no phase branch, no plan, nothing executed. Carries Phase 18's `B0` as an
  OPEN BLOCKING DEFECT (`D-IMPL-151`), explicitly reserved out of `D-GATE-18` and
  **not** accepted risk.
  WHAT IT FIXES, MEASURED IN-TREE RATHER THAN QUOTED: `DoorOutcome` carries no
  request identity (`src/ccf/products/door.py::DoorOutcome`), so both adapters fill `WireOutcome.request`
  from the object they were handed (`src/ccf/client/adapters/mcp_stdio.py::McpStdioAdapter`,
  `src/ccf/client/adapters/inprocess.py::InProcessAdapter`)
  and `src/ccf/client/client.py::ask` passes that SAME object as `sent` — `outcome.request != sent`
  is an object compared with itself. `content_address` is `sha256` of the very text
  the adapter passes on, so `verify_content_address` is `sha256(x) != sha256(x)`.
  `decode_outcome`, the one path reading both off sender-produced bytes, has NO
  SHIPPED CALL SITE.
  THE SHAPE OF THE FIX (14 decisions, `C-01`..`C-14`, in `19-CONTEXT.md`): the door
  re-states the question it resolved; the adapter seam becomes
  `ask(WireRequest) -> bytes` (AMENDS `D-11` AND `CLNT-05` — a `D-IMPL` entry is
  owed); the request is serialized too so the check is live in-process; the
  conformance suite gains generic tamper legs. Signing is OUT of scope; the restored
  claim is NON-ADVERSARIAL integrity and `D-GATE-18`'s prose constraint is replaced
  by a narrower true sentence, not lifted.
  Next action: `/clear` then `/gsd:plan-phase 19`.

Phase: **18 — MCP Transport.** EXECUTION COMPLETE (plan `17-10`, 4/4 tasks), §3.1
  CLOSE PROTOCOL DISCHARGED (cross-AI panel + depth pass in `18-CLOSE-REVIEWS.md`
  and `18-REVIEW.md`, every finding verified against the tree, four blocking
  findings closed in-phase, one — `B0` — deferred to Phase 19 as an OPEN BLOCKING
  DEFECT under `D-IMPL-151`). All four gates green at `a7264e3`: `ci-core` 3871
  passed / 118 skipped / 0 failed, `conformance` 67, `docs-strict` 0,
  `gate-tools` 400+154. **CLOSED, GATED AND MERGED** — `D-GATE-18` (Dave,
  2026-08-17); `phase-18` merged `--no-ff` into `main` at `e57c93c`, the merge
  commit referencing the gate. Merged `main` re-verified independently: all four
  gates exit 0, identical counts, so the merge introduced nothing.
  **`main` IS NOT PUSHED — 41 commits ahead of `origin/main`.** Pushing was not
  ruled and is Dave's call, as is the Actions run on `e57c93c` (no CI token in
  session; `~/ci_diag2.py` closes that loop).
  **THE GATE'S RESERVATION TRAVELS WITH THE MERGE:** it approves the portability
  claim and NOT a tamper-detection claim. `B0` — both client-seam integrity
  checks structurally unable to fail, because the adapters reconstruct the
  request echo instead of reading it off the wire — is an OPEN BLOCKING DEFECT
  carried to **Phase 19** by `D-IMPL-151`. Until Phase 19 lands, the SDK must not
  be described as detecting a transport that answered a different question, or a
  vessel altered in transit. Ten advisories also ride forward unclosed, `A5`
  among them: stdio auth is impersonation, not verification. The
  ROADMAP checkbox reads `[x]` and its row reads `1/1 — Complete`; that is
  accurate about PLANS ONLY and must not be read as a gate. Dave ruled the
  checkbox may stay (2026-08-17) provided this not-gated state stays explicit
  here. **CORRECTED 2026-08-17 (Phase 19 discuss):** the paragraph that stood
  here listed the §3.1 close protocol as *still owed* — the `D-IMPL-149` suite
  split, the cross-AI panel on shipped code, the single-agent review, finding
  verification, triage and Dave's ruling. **All of it has since been discharged**
  and is recorded in `18-CLOSE-REVIEWS.md`, `18-REVIEW.md` and `D-GATE-18`; the
  text was stale rather than wrong when written. Phase 18 IS closed and gated —
  what does not travel with the gate is the tamper-detection claim, which is
  Phase 19's job.
  Branch `phase-18`, cut
  from `main` @ `b32348f`. Plan:
  `.planning/phases/18-mcp-transport-the-second-door-and-the-portability-proof/17-10-PLAN.md`
  — the `17-10` name inside the phase-18 directory is **deliberate**; see
  `D-IMPL-147` and the banner in the file. Do not renumber it.
  Next action: none — Phase 18 is merged. See Phase 19 below.

Phase: 17 — Client Access. **CLOSED, GATED (D-GATE-17) AND MERGED TO `main`.**
  12 of 14 plans executed — 17-01…17-07, the mid-phase 17-03b Dave ruled in,
  17-11/-12/-13 (the pause), and 17-09 (the client example).
  `main` @ **`b32348f`**, pushed, clean. `phase-17` @ `44b1f75`, retained per
  CLAUDE.md §2.2.
  MERGED ONLY AFTER A GREEN ACTIONS RUN ON THE COMMIT ACTUALLY MERGED — run
  31995656672 @ `44b1f758`, all four jobs — which was Dave's condition.
  The merged `main` was then re-verified INDEPENDENTLY rather than inheriting
  the branch's result: `ci-quick-suite` 0 — 3739 passed / 0 failed / 2 skipped /
  172 deselected; `gate-tools` 0; lints 0; docs-strict 0; typecheck 0 (209
  files). Exit codes captured and BRANCHED ON, never through a pipe.
17-08 (the s1-00/s1-01 removal) and 17-10 (the MCP door + adapter):
  **DEFERRED OUT OF PHASE 17 by D-IMPL-146.** Not outstanding — both plan files
  carry a DEFERRED banner so an execute-phase run cannot pick them up. They move
  together to a later phase, where 17-08's blocker also gets its real fix (a
  producer-side example demonstrating `refuse_request` — see D-IMPL-146).

WHAT 17-09 SHIPPED, the artifact the phase was opened to produce:
  `examples/hw1-companies-over-revenue/` — `consume.py` at **78 lines** importing
  only stdlib, `ccf.client` and the adapter, beside an opaque `deployment/`
  holding **exactly ONE Python module** (`projection.py`) and three data files.
  Zero credentials. Against a populated deployment it prints the answer, the
  context debt, the content address, the replay reference and the expiry — and
  the address is stable across runs while `D_c` moves with the boundary, so the
  debt is measured rather than decorative. This is the direct answer to Dave's
  Phase 16 verdict on a 722-line example whose consumer imported the producer's
  `deployment.MANIFEST`.
Phase 16: STOPPED 2026-08-15, not gated. Post-mortem
  `.planning/HANDOFF-2026-08-15.md`. Its CI has been red for some time — the
  docs-gate half is diagnosed (stale retirement report, already fixed on
  phase-17); the tests half (exit 2 in ~45s, collection-error territory) is NOT.

WHAT THE PAUSE DELIVERED (2026-08-16, all three merged with SUMMARYs committed):
  17-11 `~ccf.products.debt_scorer.AssemblyDebtScorer` — the reference
    GraphView -> DebtAssessment adapter, row-selection choice STATED at the seam
    (rows that SURVIVED being read, with reason, consequence and override path).
    Plus `DeclaredFactor`, because the SDK has no measurement for C or S and a
    declared assumption must be distinguishable from a measurement in replay.
    11 sabotage controls, all observed failing.
  17-12 `binding.yaml` is DATA plus exactly ONE `module:attribute` reference.
    TWO refusal checks, because one would have been a precedent: `RULED_OUT_KEYS`
    refuses `resolver:`/`connection_factory:` BY NAME, and `looks_like_a_reference`
    refuses a reference-shaped value in ANY data position (key-name refusal cannot
    see one smuggled through `question.subject`). `REFERENCE_KEYS` is a
    one-element tuple ASSERTED to be one element. The fixture's 295-line
    `resolver.py` (five responsibilities) became a 127-line `projection.py` (one).
    D-IMPL-141 rewritten as RESOLVED.
  17-13 The reference scorer is the DEFAULT — in a HELPER,
    `~ccf.products.resolver.build_governed_resolver`, NOT on the class. Two
    measurements decided it: defaulting on the class would have grown
    GovernedResolver from 13 arguments to 17 (a default that enlarges its own
    seam is not a default), and a SHIPPED assertion
    (`test_no_constructor_argument_carries_a_default`) would have had to be
    weakened — this phase's signature defect, in the plan whose subject is
    inert defaults. Proven USED by EFFECT twice: the ScorerPins on a SERVED
    product, and two deployments differing in NOTHING but their λ_c table
    producing different freshness figures. A pin is a claim; a number that moves
    with its input is a measurement.
  THE ANSWER TO "what does defaulting mean when two of three factors are
    irreducibly the deployment's": THE DEFAULT IS THE MACHINERY, NEVER THE
    VALUES. 17-12's `debt:` block survives intact, all four fields, because none
    of the four is something a default may supply.

CI IS GREEN — CLOSED 2026-08-16. Run 31974549984 @ `763c846`:
  **completed / success, ALL FOUR JOBS** (examples suite, docs gate, lint +
  strict types, tests python 3.12). This is the FIRST fully green run this
  branch has ever had, and the first time the tests job ran to completion at
  all. What executed for the first time in the project's history: the quick
  suite (3695 tests), harness adapter conformance, and the FOUR SUBSTRATE LEGS
  (Postgres, Neo4j, Mongo, Fluree) plus coverage. They genuinely RAN rather
  than skipping — the job sets CCF_REQUIRE_POSTGRES/NEO4J/MONGO/FLUREE/
  HARNESSES, each of which turns a skip into a failure, so a green job with
  those set is positive evidence the legs hit real substrates.
  THE PIPELINE AND THE LOCAL GATE NOW AGREE, which is the property the
  hold-waves-6-7 ordering rule existed to protect.

  HOW IT GOT THERE, two fixes on top of the pause work:
  (a) D-IMPL-143 — `ci.yml` invoked a bare `pytest` while every Makefile target
      invokes `python -m pytest`; the `-m` form puts the cwd on sys.path and the
      console script does not. `tests/` has no top-level __init__.py, so pytest
      inserted each test file's own directory rather than the repo root and 13
      modules failed to collect. Red since at least 2026-08-10, never diagnosed,
      because every local reproduction ran through `make`. All seven pytest
      steps now CALL Makefile targets instead of restating them.
  (b) `763c846` — the frozen-baseline provenance test could NEVER pass in CI:
      actions/checkout defaults to fetch-depth 1, and a shallow clone's grafted
      root appears to introduce every file, so `git log -- <baseline>` returns
      HEAD's own subject. It now asks `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository`.
      Latent for months, invisible because the job died at collection first.

NEEDS DAVE, NOT THE SESSION:
  (1) WHETHER TO START WAVES 6 AND 7. The 2026-08-16 spec closure unblocked
      them and the CI condition Dave set ("once we have a clear CI signal,
      green or a concrete failure log, we start wave 6") is now MET. The
      session did not start them. 17-08 and 17-09 are both checkpoint plans
      (autonomous: false), so they need Dave in the loop by construction.
  (3) RULED 2026-08-16 — D-IMPL-142. The three new public names are KEPT, all
      three, with reasons recorded: `DeclaredFactor` (mechanism that makes a
      declared factor auditable in replay), `build_governed_resolver` (the
      helper is the right place for defaults, not the class) and
      `DEBT_SCORER_INPUTS` (naming required inputs beats leaving them implicit).
      Dave also ratified the discipline: claiming them in surface-change
      fragments rather than shipping them silently is correct. NO REVERSALS.

RULED 2026-08-16 ON SEQUENCING (D-IMPL-142): waves 6 and 7 are unblocked by the
  spec's closure but HELD pending a clear phase-17 CI signal — "starting the
  deletion/quarantine waves while we still don't know whether the always-on
  pipeline agrees with the local gate is the wrong order." Once CI reports
  (green, or a concrete failure log), wave 6 starts.

CI STATE, corrected and current. An earlier claim in this session that the
  branch was "~180 commits ahead of the last push Actions saw" and that
  "nothing since 8e95139 is pushed" WAS WRONG — origin/phase-17 was at a11d097,
  which is 5 commits AHEAD of 8e95139, and only 24 commits were unpushed.
  `phase-17` HAS NOW BEEN PUSHED at `5e6f55e` (a11d097..5e6f55e, exit 0, zero
  unpushed) under Dave's authorization, so Actions is running against the tree
  that contains all three plans rather than one that predates them. main
  untouched. WHAT THE SESSION CANNOT DO, measured rather than assumed: no `gh`
  CLI, no token in the environment, none in homecams' .env. SSH auth to GitHub
  WORKS (so push and fetch are available) but SSH speaks only the git protocol —
  Actions status is a REST API needing a token. `~/ci_diag.py` exists, is
  read-only stdlib, and takes a token as argv[1]; the token needs TWO separate
  grants (repository access -> ccf_code, AND Repository permissions -> Actions:
  Read-only) and granting the first does not imply the second. SECURITY: do NOT
  paste a PAT into a session transcript — three were pasted on 2026-08-10 and
  still need revoking at github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens. Run
  ci_diag.py in a shell outside the session and paste only its OUTPUT.

WHAT CLOSED 2026-08-15, both verified by the orchestrator rather than relayed:
  (1) PROPERTY-NOT-SHAPE GATING — `phase-16` was red with 18 failures and no
      defective example. `tests/examples/test_spine_separation.py` hard-coded four
      example filenames; `tests/products/test_gate_two_call_shape.py` demanded a
      binder call whose premise HW-1 does not satisfy, and had NO compliant state
      for it — it demanded the call, and property (1) would have refused that same
      call as a tautology. Both rewritten to assert the properties their docstrings
      claim. 18 -> 0 with NO example modified, which was the whole thesis: HW-1
      already held every property both gates claimed to prove. D-IMPL-137 rules the
      binder demand conditioned on its premise, detected as a CONJUNCTION of the
      Control Plane (is `ccf.projection-requirements` registered) and the AST (does
      the code read one source), fail-closed in three places, ceilinged at ONE
      exempt deployment with no headroom.
  (2) THE SINGLE-FILE FORM — plans 16-27 … 16-31. `ccf_config.yaml` is now the SOLE
      DOCUMENTED authoring surface (D-IMPL-136 AMENDMENT); the multi-file loader is
      RETAINED INDEFINITELY and no other example converts — there is still NO BULK
      MIGRATION. HW-1 went from 10 config files / 99 non-comment lines to 2 files /
      48 lines, `manifest.yaml`'s 46-line index of itself deleted outright. THE
      CONTENT ADDRESS DID NOT MOVE (5cfee793…, before and after), which is the proof
      the conversion changed nothing but the file count. D-IMPL-139 accepts 48
      against the spec's ~30 target with the gap accounted line by line.

LESSON THAT GENERALIZES, and it held across both bodies of work: EVERY defect found
  was in the VERIFICATION or in the PLANS, never in the mechanism. The gate work
  shipped five defects of its own — a guard that never fired, a test asserting its
  helpers instead of its subject, a control that could not reach its own case, a
  property asserted in four places and controlled in none, and one sentence wrong
  three distinct ways across five attempts. The config plans carried a stale
  19-failure baseline that FOUR consecutive executors disputed correctly, two file
  inventories that omitted files their own gates then demanded, and two defects in
  a plan the orchestrator wrote (an unverified `tenant_id: absent` claim that was
  false, and a `do not touch produce.py` instruction when produce.py holds the boot
  call). The instruction that earned its keep: tell every executor to EXPECT its
  plan to be wrong and to dispute with a measurement rather than route around.

STATE-HANDLER WARNING STANDS: every `state.*` and `roadmap.*` writer has corrupted
  this file — FIVE confirmed instances, whether they report success or failure.
  This entry was hand-edited after an audit that counted SUMMARY files per phase
  (161 complete) and PLAN files with no SUMMARY (14 outstanding). Note SUMMARYs can
  EXCEED PLANs — 15.1 has 20 summaries against 10 plan files, because 15.1-11 …
  15.1-20 were planned and executed mid-phase during review rounds without a
  persisted PLAN file. So SUMMARY count is the reliable "completed" signal and a
  PLAN with no SUMMARY is the reliable "outstanding" one.

    PRIOR POSITION (15.5, retained for the reasoning below):
  merge `phase-16` → `main` with `--no-ff`, then `/gsd:plan-phase 15.6`.
  PHASE 15.6 RULED IN (Dave, 2026-08-11), BEFORE Phase 16 resumes: two explicit
  tracks — A closes the five carried defects (API-neutral), B closes D-IMPL-112's
  three named gaps (API-affecting; Observation gains identity, DebtAssessment
  gains evidence pointers, and the product content address moves a THIRD time).
  Gap 1 gets a RESEARCH SPIKE FIRST in the 15.5-01 shape. Scope B to the three
  gaps, not to the open question. D-IMPL-117 (Dave): SURFACE IMPACT IS ACCEPTED
  — the address move is an authorized cost, not a risk to design around — and
  Track B ships CARRYING MECHANISM, not judgement: the context product creator
  owns what a client needs, the SDK owes only the data structure and the API to
  populate and extract it. THE SPIKE'S PRIMARY QUESTION is therefore not 'can we
  avoid the address move' but 'are these fixed fields on the vessel, or declared
  content in the payload-schema shape?' — D-IMPL-97 puts governance in fixed
  structure and domain content in a declared schema, and debt evidence sits
  across that line. The branch carries BOTH
  15.5's 15 plans AND Phase 16's completed 6 — they share the branch by design
  (forked from main @ 06fea5c per CLAUDE.md §2.2, merge at the gate not before).
  Then re-read Phase 16's 15 remaining plans BEFORE resuming: the ones
  documenting the product contract and the delivery doors describe a surface
  that no longer exists. Resume Phase 16 at 7/21 against the corrected surface.
Status: Phase 15.6 COMPLETE and gated (D-GATE-15.6, Dave, 2026-08-13) — 13 plans,
  97 commits, gate observed at HEAD a95a038 (make ci exit 0, 3086 passed / 81
  skipped). Branch `phase-15.6` is NOT pushed and NOT merged; the --no-ff merge to
  `main` is the next action. Phase 15.5 is COMPLETE and gated (D-GATE-15.5, merged
  to main @ 29e1568). Phase 16 remains PARKED at 6/21.
  PRIOR STATUS (15.6 planning, retained for the reasoning below):
  Phase 15.6 PLANNED — ready to execute.
  Branch `phase-15.6` (cut from main @ f8fe3dd per CLAUDE.md §2.2; merge at the
  gate, not before; NOT pushed). Do NOT resume Phase 16 until 15.6 lands — 15.6
  moves the product content address a THIRD time, and moving it after ten
  examples exist regenerates ten while moving it now regenerates one. Phase 16
  has already been invalidated once by exactly this.
  PRIOR STATUS (15.5 planning, retained for the reasoning below):
  WHY 15.5 EXISTS: Dave's 2026-08-10 review of `examples/s1-01-hello-context-product`
  — *"today I would put an MCP server in front of the fluree database and run a
  query and return the results. What is the benefit of using CCF?"* Measured behind
  that: three of §6.3's NINE elements (freshness SLA, discovery, addressability)
  unimplemented while `contract.py` claims they live on `RegisteredProductClass`;
  `register_product_class` takes no payload schema so `payload` is an unchecked
  dict; `DebtAssessment` computed by `ccf.halflife.debt` and delivered nowhere;
  `Perspective` passed into `execute()` by the caller with nothing deriving it from
  the verified grant, and `build_egress_server` binding no authenticator at all.
  RULINGS RECORDED: `D-IMPL-95` (systems of record read-only to L1; CCF's graph is
  CCF-owned on the same substrate), `D-IMPL-96` (revokes "no fabric changed",
  withdrawing D-13, D-14 and 16-19's gate_16.py allowlist), `D-IMPL-97` (the vessel
  model + the assembler Protocol implemented by a declared agent; a WORDING
  correction to whitepaper §7.6, explicitly not a reversal). Dave separately ruled
  entitlement requires a fabric change. Numbering continues from `D-IMPL-98`.
  TWO STANDING RULINGS THE PHASE IMPLEMENTS RATHER THAN DECIDES, found by research
  and easy to re-litigate by accident: `D-IMPL-30` already resolved the contract
  element count as NINE (Assembly Mode included) and says every "eight" reference —
  CLAUDE.md §5's included — is editorial drift; `D-IMPL-31` already ruled the
  mixing-refusal rule (`expires_at = min(class MAX_TTL ceiling, derivation over
  constituent signal validities)` with constituent-validity floors that refuse
  assembly). Criterion 8 implements it; do not re-open either.
  THE HARD CONSTRAINT ON THE DEBT TRACK: `src/ccf/replay/engine.py::replay` raises
  `ReplayDivergence` when the rehydrated product's content address differs from the
  recorded one, and `ProjectionOutput` carries only `plan_id` and `payload`. Any
  field added to `ContextProductContract` must be reconstructible from the record,
  the class, or the projection output — debt is none of them, so debt-on-the-
  product-only breaks every replay. Plan 15.5-01 measures all four placements
  against the real tripwire BEFORE 15.5-05 asks Dave to choose.
  EIGHT OPEN QUESTIONS reach 15.5-05 unruled, enumerated with options and
  consequences in `docs/CONTEXT_PRODUCT_REVISION.md` §9-§10 and in the plan. Q1
  (typed per-class request contract) gates the most — it collapses the fixed-subject
  and fixed-instant defects into one design. Q3 (debt placement) and Q7 (whether
  entitlement makes debt per-principal, or dissolves the coupling entirely) gate the
  debt track. 15.5-05 presents all eight with a MEASURED COST column and recommends
  nothing.
  PLAN-CHECKER FOUND 3 BLOCKERS + 8 WARNINGS; all fixed at `6755fa8`, and all three
  blockers were verified against the tree before being acted on. B1: criterion 4
  says "every exposed door" but the plans missed
  `runtime/ccf_runtime/mcp/experience.py::build_experience_server`, the EXTERNAL front door serving
  `context_product(tenant, product_class, version)` — a phase whose founding
  complaint is "an MCP server in front of a database" was about to ship its own MCP
  front door ungated. Now covered, and the invariant test asserts its three-door
  table is EXHAUSTIVE over runtime's product-serving handlers, so a fourth door
  fails the suite. B2: `build_egress_server(*, server_name, resolver)` binds no
  `token_verifier` — while `runtime/ccf_runtime/mcp/experience.py::build_experience_server` passes one INTO the FastMCP
  constructor, so it cannot be retrofitted — meaning plan 06's entitlement check had
  no verified grant to key off and its threat model's "Bearer-token-authenticated"
  was false. Now a third required seam, with a behavioural acceptance criterion (a
  tokenless call against a recording entitlement source must leave the recorder
  empty) because a source-order assertion would pass against a server whose
  middleware was never installed. B3: plan 01's spike asserted tree-derived counts
  inside `testpaths=["tests"]`, which `make ci-core` must keep green from wave 1 —
  over counts eight later plans change, with no owner. Now asserts only facts no
  plan is scoped to change; 15.5-14 owns its retirement.
Progress: [###░░░░░░░] 15.5 planned 0/14 · Phase 16 at 6/21, parked
  OPEN, CI — FIRST CONTACT AFTER 826 UNPUSHED COMMITS. Pushing `phase-16` on
  2026-08-10 was the first time Phases 9-15.4 ever ran in GitHub Actions. Run
  31452318023 @ a328a1b9: 3 of 4 jobs GREEN (examples suite, lint+strict types,
  docs gate). The `tests (python 3.12)` job fails at the step **"Quick suite (no
  external substrates)"**. NOT YET DIAGNOSED — and note it does NOT reproduce
  locally: that exact command passed here twice, 2464 passed / 2 skipped, both with
  `CCF_REQUIRE_HARNESSES=1` alone and with CI's FULL substrate env
  (CCF_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN / NEO4J_URI / MONGO_URI / FLUREE_URL plus all four
  CCF_REQUIRE_*). Ruled out: harness-required flag turning skips into failures; the
  `ccf-demo-adapter` entry point (installed here too, exposing backend `demo`).
  Remaining candidates: a fresh `pip install -e ".[dev,neo4j,mongo]"` resolving
  different versions than this venv, or a test that behaves differently when the
  four service containers are actually REACHABLE (CI has them; this box does not).
  NEXT STEP: read the log. `~/ci_diag.py <token>` prints the run, the failing step
  and the log tail; it now strips the Authorization header on GitHub's redirect to
  Azure blob storage, which was the 401 that blocked the log fetch. The token needs
  BOTH repository access (Only select repositories -> ccf_code) AND Repository
  permissions -> Actions: Read-only; they are separate sections and granting the
  first does not imply the second.
  SECURITY: three fine-grained PATs were pasted into the 2026-08-10 session
  transcript. REVOKE ALL THREE at github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens.
  OPEN, 16-02 (2/3): MongoDB, Neo4j and PostgreSQL on the DGX all carry 16
  relationships with `ownershipPercent` on 9 EDGES (verified by direct query after
  two out-of-tree loader patches; backups under
  `/home/parkave/fluree/examples/fibo/.backups/`). FLUREE REMAINS UNLOADED at 4 of 9
  ownership pairs — there is no Fluree loader in that harness and it is NOT a
  missing line: RDF has nowhere to hang a qualifier on a triple, which is exactly
  why the source modelled ownershipPercent on the Party and every chain was one hop.
  CCF's own adapter solves it with the interposed-edge layout (`fluree_write.py`,
  15.3 §R5). Dave has not ruled write / leave / defer.
  OPEN, 16-05 (2/3): a human-verify gate on the spine/deployment split. Superseded
  in practice by 15.5 — do not close it until the vessel work lands, since the
  example's shape is what changes.
  MEASURED, do not re-derive: the example's own algorithm is 125 executable lines
  against 189 of spine choreography and 74 of wiring, and 55 of those 74 exist only
  to satisfy `DeploymentBinding` — a Protocol the example invented, calls "the
  adoption checklist", and CCF does not ship. All eight examples call
  `load_and_boot` identically; seven differ only in a filename. Timings (not
  regression-gated): boot 74.3 ms once per process; projection execute 8.68 ms per
  question; the replay append that gates delivery 0.29 ms; full example 347 ms — so
  a second question in a live service is ~10 ms, not 347.

## Performance Metrics

- Phases complete and gated: 8/8 — Phase I closed (D-GATE-I, 2026-07-31); v0.1.0 declared
- Requirements delivered: 31/46 mapped to gated phases — RSCH-01..04, DSGN-01..04,
  FEAS-01..04, FABR-01..09, CINV-01..04, AGNT-01..03, XPRC-01..03. **CINV-04 is
  partial**: two deferral skips (`hitl-action-capture`, `workflow-trace-capture`)
  remain active and are Phase 7's to flip.

- D-GATE entries logged: 6 (D-GATE-R, D-GATE-D, D-GATE-F, D-GATE-I.1, D-GATE-I.2, D-GATE-I.3)
- Test baseline on `main`: 987 passed / 2 skipped, mypy --strict clean (99 files), `tools.lints --all` exit 0

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 13.1 inserted after Phase 13: External-Consumer Examples (MCP Egress): independent-harness agents consume CCF via MCP, zero client-side CCF imports — primary adoption path, demonstrated not asserted (Dave, 2026-08-02) (URGENT)
- Phase 13.2 inserted after Phase 13: external-example-hardening — post-execution cross-AI review re-checks for 13.1 (fixtures vs live SDK traffic, LLM tool-surface narrowing, byte-path probe, clean-runner install, .mcp.json verification) (URGENT)
- Phase 13.3 inserted after Phase 13: Review-Residual Hardening (URGENT)
- Phase 15.2 inserted after Phase 15.1: Substrate adapters and query pushdown; tiers 1+2 in scope, tier 3 designed-for
- Phase 16 edited 2026-08-09: status, goal, requirements, success_criteria — scope expanded to four sections (Phase 16 ships 1–3, Section 4 → Phase 17) per 16-CONTEXT.md D-01..D-12; ten Success Criteria added where the entry previously had none
- Phase 18.1 inserted after Phase 18: Simplify the MCP Example — Client-Side Access, Server Off-Stage. Client-experience scope, no new SDK surface: binding names the deployment, `serve.py` slimmed, README frames it as the same Context Product reached a different way with assembly deliberately out of scope. An `mcp+http`-adapter draft was written and withdrawn the same day as SDK work in an example's clothes (Dave, 2026-08-18) (URGENT)
- Phase 20 added after Phase 19 (`/gsd-phase`, Dave, 2026-08-20): Client Access from Three Harnesses — ADK, Anthropic Agent SDK and LangGraph agents reaching one Context Product over the Phase 18.1 MCP door, each printing it to the console. Continuation of the client-side arc; **no new SDK mechanism** (no transport, no adapter, no `ccf.client` change) and server assembly stays off-stage. Roadmap entry, Phases-list bullet and progress row all written BY HAND — `phase.add` produced only a stub detail section appended AFTER `## Coverage`, with no Phases-list bullet and no progress row (`D-IMPL-154`/`155` class, fifth distinct handler). Backed up and diffed: three pure insertions, zero deletions. **Ten Success Criteria authored ONE PER UNWRAPPED LINE BEFORE execution per `D-GATE-19`**; `roadmap.get-phase 20` confirmed parsed count = 10. Four open questions are named in the entry rather than decided by default (CI determinism for the three legs, one directory or three, the fate of the pre-17 and Phase-16-orphan duplicates, and the requirement lane). **ALL FOUR RULED BY DAVE THE SAME DAY, BEFORE PLANNING** — replay pattern with CI-green-by-default and no populated-deployment requirement; one directory with one README; orphans quarantined or removed and the 13.1 clients marked pre-Phase-17; `CLNT-NN` continues. Scope closed at the three clients; the ten criteria are the gate target and are not to be expanded during planning.

### Decisions

- CLAUDE.md is canonical; GSD phases map 1:1 to R/D/F/I (I sliced into I.1–I.5)
- Monorepo at `github.com/drcastillo/ccf_code` (provisional D-IMPL-10)
- Phase branches per CLAUDE.md §2.2 (`phase-r`, `phase-d`, `phase-f`, `phase-i1`..`phase-i5`); merge to `main` only at D-GATE
- Model mandates: Fable 5 high effort (Phases 1–3 / R, D, F); Opus 5 or Opus 4.8 high effort (Phases 4–8 / I)
- [Phase 02]: Entry ownership: single primary owner per INV key from pillar mapping; dual-pillar entries get See-also, never two owners
- [Phase 02]: Phase 2 planning docs carried from phase-r onto phase-d (Rule 3 — required for plan execution; planning metadata only)
- [Phase 02]: Batch 1 rulings (Dave, 2026-07-25, all AS RECOMMENDED): D-IMPL-01 Python 3.12+ sole target; 02 GraphStore Protocol + Postgres/SQLite; 03 SimilarityIndex + sqlite-vec; 04 ccf + ccf-runtime packages, async-first runtime/sync core; 05 multi-tenant first-class; 07 EmbedderProtocol; 08 Pattern-5 stage Protocols + reference pipeline; 09 LLMClientProtocol + Anthropic Citations adapter; 33 SignalEnvelope superset; 34 six-semantics storage Protocol w/ reader-writer split; 35 EntityResolutionStrategy Protocol; 37 boot-time register(); 38 OperatorParameterSet, no silent defaults; 39 MAX_TTL per class in Control Plane; 40 CAR scale/thresholds in Control Plane; 41 four-layer single-writer stack
- [Phase 02]: Batch 3 rulings (Dave, 2026-07-25, zero provisionals — marathon complete 49/49): 18 AS RECOMMENDED — D-IMPL-26 hybrid content-hash + versioned-URI addressing; 06 logical snapshots + touched-substate manifests; 17 in-SDK Workflow primitive + OrchestrationProtocol w/ LangGraph two-seam disambiguation; 20 HITLTransportProtocol typed queue, MCP primary + webhook notify-only; 27 substrate split by mutability; 36 deterministic intermediate cache; 44 ReHydrationRecipe + ColdSourceArchiveProtocol; 50 SDK-shipped fidelity lifecycle; 18 workflow state at Control Plane; 21 HumanPrincipalBinding via IdentityProvider family; 22 noun-verb CLI; 23 minimal HTTP skeleton, no L1 endpoint; 43 default human-gated closed loop; 30 nine contract elements, "eight" refs annotated as drift (incl. CLAUDE.md §5, per Dave's ruling); 31 two TTL granularities w/ derivation rule; 32 TrustScorer Protocol conjunctive; 42 prose taxonomy enum canonical; 48 Supervision Quality out of v0 scope. D-IMPL-47 REFINED: DebtFactorScorer Protocol + reference F/C/S computations PLUS evolvability — versioned scorers (scorer_id, scorer_version), Control-Plane-updatable class bindings, per-class custom override, replay pins scorer version in force. Full 12-member Phase I gate list RESOLVED
- [Phase 02]: Batch 2 rulings (Dave, 2026-07-25, zero provisionals): 13 AS RECOMMENDED — D-IMPL-28 YAML artifacts + Pydantic v2 schemas + Jinja2 prompt URIs; 11 single Agent class + Protocol-typed archetype bundles, no user subclassing; 14 LF A2A default WireProtocol + typed-HTTP fallback; 12 dynamic Control Plane skill catalog, four skill types; 19 ordered archetype composition w/ explicit conflict rules; 25 three seams mandatory, effects:unsupported = conformance-verified absence; 29 two-tier skilling governance; 13 five MCP edges via one client lib + egress server + separate ArtifactStore contract; 15 IdentityProvider Protocol, mTLS + detached JWS; 16 verify every inbound A2A product, no fast path; 45 TraceCorrelationHook + ExternalTraceProviderProtocol; 46 PassageCitationProvider Protocol. D-IMPL-24 DAVE'S OWN RULING: all three harnesses (Google ADK + Claude Agent SDK + LangGraph) ship v0 reference adapters. D-IMPL-49 REFINED: deterministic (perspective, product_class, selection_params) signature + DESIGN.md obligation to document swarm intent decomposition as orchestration-layer, named post-v0 extension

- [Phase 02]: DESIGN.md Appendix A granularity: subsection-level for §2A/§2B/§3/§6, chapter-level for §4/§5/§7; Appendix C (D-IMPL ruling index, 50 rulings) added so decision-log linkage is mechanically checkable
- [Phase 02]: D-GATE-D logged 2026-07-25 (approver Dave, zero provisionals; 5 blocking findings fixed in-phase, 7 advisory carried to Phase F); phase-d merged to main --no-ff — Phase F unblocked
- [Phase 04]: D-IMPL-52 logged (Dave, 2026-07-25): v0 examples suite is a horizontal mix of domains; example 00 + the I.1 slice fixtures are banking — replaces CLAUDE.md §9's single-neutral-domain rule (§9 amended in 04-01)
- [Phase 04]: D-12 scope amendment recorded on ROADMAP Phase 4 criterion 4 — I.1 ships ArtifactStore Protocol + file-backed dev impl only; the MCP-backed reference impl was added to Phase 6 success criteria so the deferral has a receiving deliverable
- [Phase 04]: Packaging shape — one v0 distribution ships both `ccf` (src layout) and `ccf_runtime` via `packages.find where = ["src","runtime"]`; chromadb confined to the `chroma` extra, never a core dep
- [Phase 04]: CI lint job is intentionally red on `phase-i1` until plan 04-02 lands `tools/lints` — D-07 forbids making the step non-blocking to hide the gap
- [Phase 04]: Assumption A1 resolved empirically — mypy 2.3.0 `--strict` flag surface is unchanged from the 1.x expectation
- [Phase 04]: Single-writer keyed on graph identity (database path), not one-boot-per-process — the invariant is one writer per graph; a process singleton would forbid multi-fabric hosting
- [Phase 04]: Operators are pure GraphView -> GraphView functions; the engine performs the single as-of read, so no state exists underneath an operator that could diverge between two composition orderings
- [Phase 04]: The engine records operators_invoked from execution, never from the plan's declaration — the L6 lineage strict-equality gate compares two independently produced sets or it compares nothing
- [Phase 04]: MAX_TTL is resolved from the Control Plane twice (product-class registration and gate time); no TTL number exists in /src (D-IMPL-39)
- [Phase 04]: Gate refusals are returned values; exceptions are reserved for broken deployments, so a bad product and a broken fabric are never reported the same way
- [Phase 04]: serve() is one expression because the replay append returns the delivery capability — there is no branch that reaches delivery without a recorded decision
- [Phase 04]: Similarity scores are integer percent; the canonical serializer refuses floats, so a float score could never enter a provenance chain replay compares byte for byte
- [Phase 04]: canonical.py normalizes models field-by-field rather than via model_dump() — dumping rebuilds set-valued fields as sets of dicts, making every claim in the fabric unhashable
- [Phase 04]: Every backend's GraphWriter class lives in ccf.graph._writer, never beside its reader — otherwise the CINV-02 lint guards a module while the real write path lives unguarded
- [Phase 04]: claim_id excludes lineage and observed_at — corroboration accumulates instead of manufacturing supersessions, and a claim stays addressable while its evidence grows
- [Phase 05]: D-05 content comparison uses version-normalized fingerprint (artifact_version blanked) so a bump alone never reads as a content change
- [Phase 05]: delegation_chain defaults to single-element NO_AGENT_DEFINITION chain; build_replay_record passes single-element originating-principal chain (I.2)
- [Phase 05]: Factory resolves ccf-artifact:// refs via Control Plane key {tenant}/{class}/{name}, matching URI version against each registered version's declared artifact_version/semver (content hashes also accepted); reads through Control Plane resolution only, never raw storage
- [Phase 05]: Agent seam failures (ConsumptionRefused, SkillNotBound, AgentConstructionError) are typed exceptions, not returned refusals — broken wiring, not expected artifact outcomes (I.1 refusal-vs-exception line)
- [Phase 05]: SkillCatalog stores only a key index; the registry stays the single source of skill entry content — discovery/resolution read the same audited versions as every Control Plane consumer (05-05)
- [Phase 05]: Skill bindings are pure descriptors in 05-05 (D-08) — no transport or resolution code for any of the four types until 05-06 dispatch
- [Phase 05]: build_replay_record gained optional agent_conditioning seam — agent-serialized dimension-4 conditioning recorded verbatim; None keeps I.1 behavior byte for byte (no contract change)
- [Phase 05]: Tier-1 governance envelope reads a `skill_governance` field (typed PolicyRegimeGovernance) from the policy-regime declaration — field name is mechanism schema; permitted scopes and the tier-2 flag are deployment YAML statements (05-06)
- [Phase 05]: Grant transitions audit as new grant_* AuditAction members through the one existing AuditLog — no parallel log type (05-06)
- [Phase 05]: NotYetBound is a typed RuntimeError for mcp/a2a dispatch (build lacks the transport; artifact is fine) — RESEARCH Open Question 2 resolution; tool dispatch returns a ToolInvocation value, the SDK executes no command (05-06)
- [Phase 05]: Agent holds bound_skills by reference to the GrantLedger's live view — grants/revocations take effect at invoke time without touching agent identity; ledger.grant_set_hash() returns the NO_GRANTS sentinel when empty, pure fn stays content_hash(frozenset) (D-07, 05-06)
- [Phase 05]: Gate package (docs/PHASE_I2_GATE.md) follows the I.1 D-17 format; discretionary in-phase choices recorded in the gate doc §4, not as D-IMPL entries; D-GATE-I.2 deliberately NOT logged pending Dave's approval (05-07)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-60 (Dave, 2026-07-29): all three v0 SDKs get real OrchestrationProtocol drivers under `runtime/ccf_runtime/orchestration/<sdk>/` with bidirectional adapter-import ban; D-IMPL-17 cross-referenced, not edited (07-01)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-61 (Dave, 2026-07-30): absent per-node exception ref = propagate-to-terminal — a defined, audited transition to a terminal `failed` state recorded in the trace; validation-error reading declined (let-it-fail stays expressible). Gates 07-04's exception-routing validator (07-01)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-62 (Dave, 2026-07-30): HTTP/CLI HITL action door is submit-only with honest-contract hardening — `HitlActionReceipt` states `submitted` (type-closed) with real queue disposition; MCP in-process resolve-wiring is a ruled asymmetry; auth stays on T-07-24's residual entry (07-14)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-63 (Dave, 2026-07-30): the two D-IMPL-21 identity-binding reference impls are explicit follow-up-phase scope; caller-supplied principal fields are the recorded v0 posture (07-14)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-64 (Dave, 2026-07-30): webhook deferral REJECTED — the notify-only webhook HITL transport ships in v0 (`ccf.hitl.webhook`: injected `WebhookDeliveryProtocol`, typed refusals, no authority surface by construction) (07-14)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-65 (Dave, 2026-07-30): composition-root debt-cascade wiring closes the I.4 gate; NAMED next-phase commitment — the engine will refuse an agent-node handoff with no bound debt assessment (07-14)
- [Phase 07]: fastapi==0.140.0 and httpx==0.28.1 are direct pins with stated reasons; CLI is stdlib argparse (no click/typer); ADK's `fastapi>=0.133` constraint interaction recorded for the gate (07-01)
- [Phase 08]: D-15 executed — `ccf hitl decide` removed tree-wide, `submit` is the one verb; DECISIONS.md entry dated 2026-07-30 (08-02)
- [Phase 08]: HITL HTTP door fails closed on non-TokenGrant grant objects (403 ERROR_INVALID_GRANT, never caller-principal fallback); refusal bodies carry typed `error_code` constants from `http_api/errors.py`, with `ERROR_SIGNED_BINDING_{REQUIRED,INVALID}` reserved for 08-03 (08-02)
- [Phase ?]: 08-03: HitlPolicy artifact (ccf.hitl-policy) with schema-validated signed_binding_required (default false); D-16 refusals typed at the transport and mapped to shared ERROR_SIGNED_BINDING_* constants at both HTTP and MCP doors; R1 closed with was-called assertions
- [Phase 08]: Example 07 store choice is a config artifact (`store.type`) interpreted by one factory seam; file root and MCP endpoint are env-templated so no path or port is committed; the MCP child interprets the same store_mcp.yaml auth block as the client factory, so credentials cannot drift (08-09)
- [Phase ?]: ADK migration taken over suppression: google.adk.workflow.Workflow usable at 2.5.0 (BaseAgent is BaseNode); D-08 allowlist carries the harness Workflow name-collision, allowlist path matching Rule-1-fixed (08-04)
- [Phase 08]: 08-12 — make ci finalized as ci-core + examples (the phase gate command, command-identical to the always-on Actions pipeline, D-10); live legs opt-in via live-legs.yml workflow_dispatch (Ollama model parameterized, default qwen3:0.6b; Anthropic secret-gated fail-fast) per D-11; push of phase-i5 flagged for Dave, not performed
- [Phase 08]: A3 closed with zero adapter change — the discharge test and example 03's Claude leg drive a genuinely SDK-parsed ResultMessage through seam 4; example 03's session runs over the adapter's own seam-1 carrier, and legs/deterministic.py imports all three harness SDKs unconditionally so a missing harness is a failure, not a skip (08-10)
- [Phase 08]: 08-13 — D-GATE-I logged (Dave, 2026-07-31): Phase I approved, v0.1.0 tagged on the main merge commit (358ba0d), push authorized and performed; review disposition X-1 fixed in-phase (composition-coverage row narrowed to the shipped_operators() test registry), C-4 rejected with rationale (README tracks CLAUDE.md mission wording)

### Todos

- Plan Phase 9 (`/gsd:plan-phase 9`) — includes surfacing the six-item D-IMPL ruling batch to Dave (HARD-01)
- Phases 10–14 gated: 10 on the Phase 9 rulings; 11 on the hardened surface + perf-governance ruling; 13 on Phase 10 (parallel to 11/12); 14 on 11+12+13 outputs + docs-toolchain/D-10 rulings

### Blockers

- ~~Phase 4 (Phase I.1) hard-gated on provisional resolution of D-IMPL-01..05, 11, 14, 17, 20, 24, 26, 28~~ — CLEARED 2026-07-25: all 12 gating IDs RESOLVED (batch 3 completed 17, 20, 26)
- Every phase gate requires Dave's approval + `D-GATE-<Phase>` entry; `/gsd-review` passing is necessary, never sufficient

## Session Continuity

Last action: 08-13 complete (2026-07-31) — Phase I gated and v0.1.0
declared: D-GATE-I logged, phase-i5 merged to main --no-ff, v0.1.0 tagged
on the merge commit, main/phase-i5/v0.1.0 pushed to origin per Dave's
authorization. Prior: 08-12 — examples suite
wired into CI per D-10/D-11 (EXAM-09, Task 1 f145f1e): ci.yml always-on
`examples` job (make examples, CCF_REQUIRE_HARNESSES=1, timeout-minutes
20, never continue-on-error) plus new live-legs.yml (workflow_dispatch
examples-live-ollama with parameterized small model; secret-gated
examples-live-anthropic with fail-fast); `make ci` finalized = ci-core +
examples. Full local sweep GREEN (Task 2 evidence-only): lint 0, mypy
clean (156 files), pytest 1339 passed / 0 skipped, all eight examples
exit 0, D-09 README/artifacts contract check 8/8 PASS.

Next action: v0 is declared — milestone complete. Post-v0 backlog:
Homecams-on-SDK rebuild, PyPI motion, perf baselines, replay-explorer /
graph-export CLI ideas. Observe the first Actions runs on origin for the
EXAM-09 observed-evidence record.

**2026-08-05 session resume.** Phase 15 (SDK Ergonomics) is executing at
18/21 plans; waves 1–11 merged to `main` at `5fbb8e0`, handoff saved at
`60a148b`, tree clean, no worktrees. Full checkpoint context — Dave's six
in-execution rulings, the `_register_closure` evidence for 15-19, the two
self-satisfying-assertion defects 15-21's audit must cite, and the
worktree/`.venv` operational notes — lives in
`.planning/phases/15-sdk-ergonomics-the-integration-surface/.continue-here.md`.
Remaining: wave 12 = 15-19 (example 05 workflow-HITL, autonomous),
wave 13 = 15-20 (external 00-hello-context, autonomous), wave 14 = 15-21
(phase close + Criterion 1 audit, **checkpoint — not autonomous**).
Gates green at handoff: 1908 passed/2 skipped, lint 0, typecheck 169 files,
ten examples, docs-strict, schema-headers.

Resume: `/gsd-execute-phase 15`

**2026-08-18 session resume.** Phase 18.1 discussion RESUMED mid-flight.
`.planning/phases/18.1-simplify-the-mcp-example-separate-the-server-from-the-client/18.1-DISCUSS-CHECKPOINT.json`
(untracked, written 11:55) holds one completed area — *Where the server command
is declared*, five questions ruled — plus one question of *The address grammar
after the change*. Locked so far: a bare `server:` key in `binding.yaml` holding
a single contained path (SDK still supplies the interpreter and still passes the
deployment root as `argv[1]`); `server/` moves INSIDE the deployment root as
`deployment/server/` so containment holds without an exemption; `D-IMPL-141` A.3
amended in writing AND its gate extended to walk the whole tree (exactly one
module at the deployment root, Python elsewhere only under the directory
`binding.yaml` declares); the two-token `mcp+stdio` address form REPLACED by one
token, refusal naming the migration. Remaining areas: *How simple is simple
enough for `serve.py`*, *What the README shows and what goes off-stage*.
Nothing planned, nothing executed; no phase branch. `main` clean and 41 commits
ahead of `origin/main` (push unruled).

**Discussion COMPLETE** — all four areas closed in the afternoon sitting, checkpoint
deleted, `18.1-CONTEXT.md` and `18.1-DISCUSSION-LOG.md` committed at `60f2bd3`. The
morning's server-residence ruling was reopened by Dave and reversed (see Current
Position). Nothing planned, nothing executed; no phase branch. `main` clean and now
43 commits ahead of `origin/main` (push still unruled).

Resume: `/gsd:plan-phase 18.1`
