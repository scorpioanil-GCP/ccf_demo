  2026-08-15 PM -- Phase 16 STOPPED (example surface rejected by Dave). Phase 17 OPENED, DESIGNED
  and PLANNED in one session: ccf.client transport-agnostic client access. Spec c709d5b; Amendment 1
  ab48d9a (research closed two design gaps -- no door emits a refusal, and no src-resident seam
  yields a gated product); demo-data ruling f0467c1; 10 plans 725aaf4; revisions 376400c and 64f5e6a.
  Plan-checker round 1: 4 blockers + 10 warnings, all fixed. Round 2: VERIFICATION PASSED, 5
  warnings, all folded in. READY TO EXECUTE.

  PHASE 17 PLANNED AND READY TO EXECUTE (2026-08-15). 10 plans in 8 waves, HEAD 64f5e6a, tree clean,
  NOT PUSHED. Waves: 1 = 17-01 (retirement sweep + tools/ repair, D-31) || 17-02 (refusal envelope,
  D-28); 2 = 17-03 (resolver seam, D-29) || 17-04 (wire + codec); 3 = 17-05 client surface; 4 =
  17-06 in-process adapter; 5 = 17-07 conformance suite; 6 = 17-08 tree disposition (autonomous
  FALSE); 7 = 17-09 the example (autonomous FALSE); 8 = 17-10 MCP door + adapter. TWO RULINGS WAIT
  FOR DAVE MID-EXECUTION: (a) D-IMPL-140, a `binding.yaml` document in the backends.yaml posture --
  proposed not ruled, because a folder binding cannot say HOW to serve a product and DeploymentConfig
  is closed-world; isolated behind a loader in 17-06 Task 1 so a different ruling rewrites one task.
  (b) 17-08's checkpoint on examples/00-08 -- cited 111 times across 15 published pages, so deletion
  strands them and the repair is Phase 16's stopped DOCS-17 inside a client-only phase; the plan
  QUARANTINES with a regenerated inventory and refuses to delete on an executor's authority.
  PLAN-CHECKER HISTORY, and it is the phase's best evidence: round 1 found 4 blockers, NONE in the
  design, ALL in proof machinery -- a refusal table listing 9 of 17 kinds behind an import-order-
  dependent gate (5 subclasses one way, 12 the other); a door-detector keyed on two hard-coded
  protocol names that would have discovered ZERO doors while its sabotage control passed (the Phase
  15.1 Gate 2 shape); a whole CLASS of sabotage controls specified as copy-to-tmp_path against
  assertions that read imported modules; and a wire field typed `bytes` when canonical_bytes refuses
  bytes outright. Round 2 PASSED with the widened detector empirically proven not to change the
  runtime discovery set. The five round-2 warnings included a real gate hole: the *Violation half of
  the refusal vocabulary was enumerated by three HARD-CODED names, so a new one would ship
  untranslated with the gate green -- now closed by a second named allowlist and set equality.
  PRIOR POSITION (pre-planning, retained): PHASE 17 OPENED 2026-08-15, DESIGN APPROVED, PLANNING NOT
  STARTED. Branch `phase-17` cut from the
  `phase-16` tip (d9f117b) so the SDK-keep work (single-file ccf_config loader D-IMPL-136, property
  gates D-IMPL-137/-138) travels with it; spec committed at c709d5b. THE AUTHORITATIVE INPUT is
  docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-ccf-client-design.md -- read it before planning anything. In one
  breath: CCF owns the client abstraction and the Result contract; transports are adapters
  (in-process first, MCP second, HTTP/A2A later) that all return the same Result via ONE decode
  path; refusal is a value, negligence is an exception, wire failure is an exception; fail-closed
  guards on post-assembly fields; CCF_BINDING scheme-prefixed resolution, deliberately minimal;
  in-process round-trips the canonical codec (ruled YES); adapter conformance suite is the CI parity
  gate; first example is consume.py <= 80 lines importing only ccf.client + stdlib (purity + budget
  gates in CI). Scope discipline: CLIENT ROLE ONLY -- producer-side construction examples are later
  work. CONSEQUENCES RULED (spec section 11): Phase 16 example-shape rulings SUSPENDED (D-11 of
  16-CONTEXT, D-IMPL-125, D-IMPL-127's file-shape aspect, D-IMPL-131, D-IMPL-139a); SDK rulings
  STAND (D-IMPL-132/-136/-137/-138); tests/examples/test_spine_separation.py must be re-scoped or
  retired before it refuses new examples; condemned example trees (s1-00, s1-01, 00-08) removed or
  quarantined early in Phase 17. PHASE 16 IS STOPPED, NOT GATED -- its 14 remaining doc plans
  (16-07..16-20) documented the rejected surface and stay unwritten; its ROADMAP entry carries the
  stop note. The verdict, Dave verbatim: the first example "fails miserably" -- 722 lines of Python
  with consume.py importing the producer's deployment config. Full post-mortem in
  .planning/HANDOFF-2026-08-15.md. PRIOR POSITION (Phase 16 execution, retained):
  PHASE 16 EXECUTING AT 16 OF 30, two bodies of work closed 2026-08-15 and NOT YET PUSHED.
  `phase-16` is 27 commits ahead of `origin/phase-16` and 90 ahead of `main`. PHASE 15.6 IS
  COMPLETE, GATED **AND MERGED** — `main` is at 6e95da0; this field previously claimed that merge
  was the NEXT ACTION and had not happened, which was wrong for two days. (1) PROPERTY-NOT-SHAPE
  GATING: the branch was red with 18 failures and no defective example. Both universal gates encoded
  "every example must look like THIS" — the rigidity D-IMPL-132 forbade for operators, applied to
  examples. test_spine_separation.py hard-coded four filenames; test_gate_two_call_shape.py demanded
  a binder call whose premise HW-1 does not satisfy and had NO COMPLIANT STATE for it, since
  property (1) would have refused the very call it demanded. Rewritten to assert the properties
  their docstrings claim: 18 -> 0 with NO EXAMPLE MODIFIED, which was the thesis — HW-1 already held
  every property both gates claimed to prove. D-IMPL-137 conditions the demand on its premise,
  detected as a CONJUNCTION of the Control Plane (is `ccf.projection-requirements` registered) and
  the AST (does the code read one source); fail-closed in three places; ceiling of ONE exempt
  deployment, no headroom. (2) THE SINGLE-FILE FORM, plans 16-27..16-31: `ccf_config.yaml` is the
  SOLE DOCUMENTED authoring surface (D-IMPL-136 AMENDMENT, 2026-08-15). The multi-file loader is
  RETAINED INDEFINITELY, no other example converts, NO BULK MIGRATION. HW-1: 10 config files / 99
  non-comment lines -> 2 files / 48 lines, manifest.yaml's 46-line index of itself deleted. THE
  CONTENT ADDRESS DID NOT MOVE (5cfee793e5fb686a82becac08cddf2ca187c3ef9ae26bd9a8fd41030656a6d36
  before and after) — pin identity IS content identity, so that is the proof the conversion changed
  nothing but the file count. D-IMPL-138 ruled the four plan escalations; D-IMPL-139 accepts 48
  lines against the spec's ~30 with the gap accounted line by line, and records that D-IMPL-137's
  _deployment_root was extended to the single-file shape ADDITIVELY — exempt list unchanged, ceiling
  still 1, fail-closed still answers None, conjunction intact, verified not argued. REMAINING: 14
  plans, 16-07..16-20 — the documentation block, which documents the surface these two days changed,
  which is why 16-14 was rewired to depend on 16-31 rather than 16-30. THE LESSON, and it held
  across both bodies of work: EVERY defect found was in the VERIFICATION or in the PLANS, never in
  the mechanism. The gate work shipped five of its own — a guard that never fired, a test asserting
  its helpers instead of its subject, a control that could not reach its own case, a property
  asserted in four places and controlled in none, and one sentence wrong three distinct ways across
  five attempts. The config plans carried a stale 19-failure baseline FOUR consecutive executors
  disputed correctly, two file inventories omitting files their own gates then demanded, and two
  defects in a plan the orchestrator wrote — an unverified "tenant_id absent" claim that was false,
  and "do not touch produce.py" when produce.py holds the boot call. STATE-HANDLER WARNING STANDS:
  every state.* and roadmap.* writer has corrupted this file, FIVE confirmed instances, whether they
  report success or failure. This entry was hand-edited after an audit; SUMMARY count is the
  reliable completed signal (161) and a PLAN with no SUMMARY the outstanding one (14) — note
  SUMMARYs can EXCEED PLANs, as 15.1 has 20 against 10. OPERATIONAL, UNCHANGED: mongo on port 27019
  (wrong port HANGS — use CCF_TEST_MONGO_URI); NEO4J_PASSWORD and PGPASSWORD for the DGX are not in
  this environment; the FIBO harness is at /home/parkave/fluree/examples/fibo/ (192.168.4.76).

# STATE — CCF SDK

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Whitepaper fidelity — every load-bearing primitive in
`docs/CCF_Whitepaper_1-2.md` realized in code with its contracts, invariants,
and composition properties. Priority order: fidelity → general-purposeness →
harness neutrality → adoptability. `/home/parkave/ccf_code/CLAUDE.md` (rev 4)
is canonical for phases, review protocol, invariants, and decision log.

**Current focus:** Phase 17 — Client Access (`ccf.client`). Design brainstormed
with Dave and **approved 2026-08-15**; the authoritative input is
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-ccf-client-design.md`. Phase 16 is **stopped**
(example surface rejected; SDK-keep work survives on the branch lineage).

## Current Position

Phase: 17 — Client Access: `ccf.client` and the transport-agnostic first example.
  OPENED 2026-08-15; design approved; planning not started. Branch `phase-17`
  (cut from `phase-16` tip d9f117b; spec committed at c709d5b).
Phase 16: STOPPED 2026-08-15, not gated — first example rejected by Dave at 722
  lines of Python with the consumer importing producer config. The 14 remaining
  documentation plans (16-07…16-20) stay unwritten. Post-mortem:
  `.planning/HANDOFF-2026-08-15.md`. ROADMAP entries for both phases updated by
  hand this session.

NEXT ACTION: plan Phase 17 (`/gsd:plan-phase 17`, with the spec as input — the
  design decisions are already converged and ruled; planning sequences them).
  Early plans must cover: `ccf.client` core + Result contract, in-process
  adapter + canonical codec, conformance suite, first example with purity/budget
  gates, `test_spine_separation.py` re-scope/retire, condemned-tree disposition.
  Push `phase-17` when Dave says push.

WHAT CLOSED 2026-08-15, both verified by the orchestrator rather than relayed:
  (1) PROPERTY-NOT-SHAPE GATING — `phase-16` was red with 18 failures and no
      defective example. `tests/examples/test_spine_separation.py` hard-coded four
      example filenames; `tests/products/test_gate_two_call_shape.py` demanded a
      binder call whose premise HW-1 does not satisfy, and had NO compliant state
      for it — it demanded the call, and property (1) would have refused that same
      call as a tautology. Both rewritten to assert the properties their docstrings
      claim. 18 -> 0 with NO example modified, which was the whole thesis: HW-1
      already held every property both gates claimed to prove. D-IMPL-137 rules the
      binder demand conditioned on its premise, detected as a CONJUNCTION of the
      Control Plane (is `ccf.projection-requirements` registered) and the AST (does
      the code read one source), fail-closed in three places, ceilinged at ONE
      exempt deployment with no headroom.
  (2) THE SINGLE-FILE FORM — plans 16-27 … 16-31. `ccf_config.yaml` is now the SOLE
      DOCUMENTED authoring surface (D-IMPL-136 AMENDMENT); the multi-file loader is
      RETAINED INDEFINITELY and no other example converts — there is still NO BULK
      MIGRATION. HW-1 went from 10 config files / 99 non-comment lines to 2 files /
      48 lines, `manifest.yaml`'s 46-line index of itself deleted outright. THE
      CONTENT ADDRESS DID NOT MOVE (5cfee793…, before and after), which is the proof
      the conversion changed nothing but the file count. D-IMPL-139 accepts 48
      against the spec's ~30 target with the gap accounted line by line.

LESSON THAT GENERALIZES, and it held across both bodies of work: EVERY defect found
  was in the VERIFICATION or in the PLANS, never in the mechanism. The gate work
  shipped five defects of its own — a guard that never fired, a test asserting its
  helpers instead of its subject, a control that could not reach its own case, a
  property asserted in four places and controlled in none, and one sentence wrong
  three distinct ways across five attempts. The config plans carried a stale
  19-failure baseline that FOUR consecutive executors disputed correctly, two file
  inventories that omitted files their own gates then demanded, and two defects in
  a plan the orchestrator wrote (an unverified `tenant_id: absent` claim that was
  false, and a `do not touch produce.py` instruction when produce.py holds the boot
  call). The instruction that earned its keep: tell every executor to EXPECT its
  plan to be wrong and to dispute with a measurement rather than route around.

STATE-HANDLER WARNING STANDS: every `state.*` and `roadmap.*` writer has corrupted
  this file — FIVE confirmed instances, whether they report success or failure.
  This entry was hand-edited after an audit that counted SUMMARY files per phase
  (161 complete) and PLAN files with no SUMMARY (14 outstanding). Note SUMMARYs can
  EXCEED PLANs — 15.1 has 20 summaries against 10 plan files, because 15.1-11 …
  15.1-20 were planned and executed mid-phase during review rounds without a
  persisted PLAN file. So SUMMARY count is the reliable "completed" signal and a
  PLAN with no SUMMARY is the reliable "outstanding" one.

    PRIOR POSITION (15.5, retained for the reasoning below):
  merge `phase-16` → `main` with `--no-ff`, then `/gsd:plan-phase 15.6`.
  PHASE 15.6 RULED IN (Dave, 2026-08-11), BEFORE Phase 16 resumes: two explicit
  tracks — A closes the five carried defects (API-neutral), B closes D-IMPL-112's
  three named gaps (API-affecting; Observation gains identity, DebtAssessment
  gains evidence pointers, and the product content address moves a THIRD time).
  Gap 1 gets a RESEARCH SPIKE FIRST in the 15.5-01 shape. Scope B to the three
  gaps, not to the open question. D-IMPL-117 (Dave): SURFACE IMPACT IS ACCEPTED
  — the address move is an authorized cost, not a risk to design around — and
  Track B ships CARRYING MECHANISM, not judgement: the context product creator
  owns what a client needs, the SDK owes only the data structure and the API to
  populate and extract it. THE SPIKE'S PRIMARY QUESTION is therefore not 'can we
  avoid the address move' but 'are these fixed fields on the vessel, or declared
  content in the payload-schema shape?' — D-IMPL-97 puts governance in fixed
  structure and domain content in a declared schema, and debt evidence sits
  across that line. The branch carries BOTH
  15.5's 15 plans AND Phase 16's completed 6 — they share the branch by design
  (forked from main @ 06fea5c per CLAUDE.md §2.2, merge at the gate not before).
  Then re-read Phase 16's 15 remaining plans BEFORE resuming: the ones
  documenting the product contract and the delivery doors describe a surface
  that no longer exists. Resume Phase 16 at 7/21 against the corrected surface.
Status: Phase 15.6 COMPLETE and gated (D-GATE-15.6, Dave, 2026-08-13) — 13 plans,
  97 commits, gate observed at HEAD a95a038 (make ci exit 0, 3086 passed / 81
  skipped). Branch `phase-15.6` is NOT pushed and NOT merged; the --no-ff merge to
  `main` is the next action. Phase 15.5 is COMPLETE and gated (D-GATE-15.5, merged
  to main @ 29e1568). Phase 16 remains PARKED at 6/21.
  PRIOR STATUS (15.6 planning, retained for the reasoning below):
  Phase 15.6 PLANNED — ready to execute.
  Branch `phase-15.6` (cut from main @ f8fe3dd per CLAUDE.md §2.2; merge at the
  gate, not before; NOT pushed). Do NOT resume Phase 16 until 15.6 lands — 15.6
  moves the product content address a THIRD time, and moving it after ten
  examples exist regenerates ten while moving it now regenerates one. Phase 16
  has already been invalidated once by exactly this.
  PRIOR STATUS (15.5 planning, retained for the reasoning below):
  WHY 15.5 EXISTS: Dave's 2026-08-10 review of `examples/s1-01-hello-context-product`
  — *"today I would put an MCP server in front of the fluree database and run a
  query and return the results. What is the benefit of using CCF?"* Measured behind
  that: three of §6.3's NINE elements (freshness SLA, discovery, addressability)
  unimplemented while `contract.py` claims they live on `RegisteredProductClass`;
  `register_product_class` takes no payload schema so `payload` is an unchecked
  dict; `DebtAssessment` computed by `ccf.halflife.debt` and delivered nowhere;
  `Perspective` passed into `execute()` by the caller with nothing deriving it from
  the verified grant, and `build_egress_server` binding no authenticator at all.
  RULINGS RECORDED: `D-IMPL-95` (systems of record read-only to L1; CCF's graph is
  CCF-owned on the same substrate), `D-IMPL-96` (revokes "no fabric changed",
  withdrawing D-13, D-14 and 16-19's gate_16.py allowlist), `D-IMPL-97` (the vessel
  model + the assembler Protocol implemented by a declared agent; a WORDING
  correction to whitepaper §7.6, explicitly not a reversal). Dave separately ruled
  entitlement requires a fabric change. Numbering continues from `D-IMPL-98`.
  TWO STANDING RULINGS THE PHASE IMPLEMENTS RATHER THAN DECIDES, found by research
  and easy to re-litigate by accident: `D-IMPL-30` already resolved the contract
  element count as NINE (Assembly Mode included) and says every "eight" reference —
  CLAUDE.md §5's included — is editorial drift; `D-IMPL-31` already ruled the
  mixing-refusal rule (`expires_at = min(class MAX_TTL ceiling, derivation over
  constituent signal validities)` with constituent-validity floors that refuse
  assembly). Criterion 8 implements it; do not re-open either.
  THE HARD CONSTRAINT ON THE DEBT TRACK: `src/ccf/replay/engine.py::replay` raises
  `ReplayDivergence` when the rehydrated product's content address differs from the
  recorded one, and `ProjectionOutput` carries only `plan_id` and `payload`. Any
  field added to `ContextProductContract` must be reconstructible from the record,
  the class, or the projection output — debt is none of them, so debt-on-the-
  product-only breaks every replay. Plan 15.5-01 measures all four placements
  against the real tripwire BEFORE 15.5-05 asks Dave to choose.
  EIGHT OPEN QUESTIONS reach 15.5-05 unruled, enumerated with options and
  consequences in `docs/CONTEXT_PRODUCT_REVISION.md` §9-§10 and in the plan. Q1
  (typed per-class request contract) gates the most — it collapses the fixed-subject
  and fixed-instant defects into one design. Q3 (debt placement) and Q7 (whether
  entitlement makes debt per-principal, or dissolves the coupling entirely) gate the
  debt track. 15.5-05 presents all eight with a MEASURED COST column and recommends
  nothing.
  PLAN-CHECKER FOUND 3 BLOCKERS + 8 WARNINGS; all fixed at `6755fa8`, and all three
  blockers were verified against the tree before being acted on. B1: criterion 4
  says "every exposed door" but the plans missed
  `runtime/ccf_runtime/mcp/experience.py::build_experience_server`, the EXTERNAL front door serving
  `context_product(tenant, product_class, version)` — a phase whose founding
  complaint is "an MCP server in front of a database" was about to ship its own MCP
  front door ungated. Now covered, and the invariant test asserts its three-door
  table is EXHAUSTIVE over runtime's product-serving handlers, so a fourth door
  fails the suite. B2: `build_egress_server(*, server_name, resolver)` binds no
  `token_verifier` — while `runtime/ccf_runtime/mcp/experience.py::build_experience_server` passes one INTO the FastMCP
  constructor, so it cannot be retrofitted — meaning plan 06's entitlement check had
  no verified grant to key off and its threat model's "Bearer-token-authenticated"
  was false. Now a third required seam, with a behavioural acceptance criterion (a
  tokenless call against a recording entitlement source must leave the recorder
  empty) because a source-order assertion would pass against a server whose
  middleware was never installed. B3: plan 01's spike asserted tree-derived counts
  inside `testpaths=["tests"]`, which `make ci-core` must keep green from wave 1 —
  over counts eight later plans change, with no owner. Now asserts only facts no
  plan is scoped to change; 15.5-14 owns its retirement.
Progress: [###░░░░░░░] 15.5 planned 0/14 · Phase 16 at 6/21, parked
  OPEN, CI — FIRST CONTACT AFTER 826 UNPUSHED COMMITS. Pushing `phase-16` on
  2026-08-10 was the first time Phases 9-15.4 ever ran in GitHub Actions. Run
  31452318023 @ a328a1b9: 3 of 4 jobs GREEN (examples suite, lint+strict types,
  docs gate). The `tests (python 3.12)` job fails at the step **"Quick suite (no
  external substrates)"**. NOT YET DIAGNOSED — and note it does NOT reproduce
  locally: that exact command passed here twice, 2464 passed / 2 skipped, both with
  `CCF_REQUIRE_HARNESSES=1` alone and with CI's FULL substrate env
  (CCF_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN / NEO4J_URI / MONGO_URI / FLUREE_URL plus all four
  CCF_REQUIRE_*). Ruled out: harness-required flag turning skips into failures; the
  `ccf-demo-adapter` entry point (installed here too, exposing backend `demo`).
  Remaining candidates: a fresh `pip install -e ".[dev,neo4j,mongo]"` resolving
  different versions than this venv, or a test that behaves differently when the
  four service containers are actually REACHABLE (CI has them; this box does not).
  NEXT STEP: read the log. `~/ci_diag.py <token>` prints the run, the failing step
  and the log tail; it now strips the Authorization header on GitHub's redirect to
  Azure blob storage, which was the 401 that blocked the log fetch. The token needs
  BOTH repository access (Only select repositories -> ccf_code) AND Repository
  permissions -> Actions: Read-only; they are separate sections and granting the
  first does not imply the second.
  SECURITY: three fine-grained PATs were pasted into the 2026-08-10 session
  transcript. REVOKE ALL THREE at github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens.
  OPEN, 16-02 (2/3): MongoDB, Neo4j and PostgreSQL on the DGX all carry 16
  relationships with `ownershipPercent` on 9 EDGES (verified by direct query after
  two out-of-tree loader patches; backups under
  `/home/parkave/fluree/examples/fibo/.backups/`). FLUREE REMAINS UNLOADED at 4 of 9
  ownership pairs — there is no Fluree loader in that harness and it is NOT a
  missing line: RDF has nowhere to hang a qualifier on a triple, which is exactly
  why the source modelled ownershipPercent on the Party and every chain was one hop.
  CCF's own adapter solves it with the interposed-edge layout (`fluree_write.py`,
  15.3 §R5). Dave has not ruled write / leave / defer.
  OPEN, 16-05 (2/3): a human-verify gate on the spine/deployment split. Superseded
  in practice by 15.5 — do not close it until the vessel work lands, since the
  example's shape is what changes.
  MEASURED, do not re-derive: the example's own algorithm is 125 executable lines
  against 189 of spine choreography and 74 of wiring, and 55 of those 74 exist only
  to satisfy `DeploymentBinding` — a Protocol the example invented, calls "the
  adoption checklist", and CCF does not ship. All eight examples call
  `load_and_boot` identically; seven differ only in a filename. Timings (not
  regression-gated): boot 74.3 ms once per process; projection execute 8.68 ms per
  question; the replay append that gates delivery 0.29 ms; full example 347 ms — so
  a second question in a live service is ~10 ms, not 347.

## Performance Metrics

- Phases complete and gated: 8/8 — Phase I closed (D-GATE-I, 2026-07-31); v0.1.0 declared
- Requirements delivered: 31/46 mapped to gated phases — RSCH-01..04, DSGN-01..04,
  FEAS-01..04, FABR-01..09, CINV-01..04, AGNT-01..03, XPRC-01..03. **CINV-04 is
  partial**: two deferral skips (`hitl-action-capture`, `workflow-trace-capture`)
  remain active and are Phase 7's to flip.

- D-GATE entries logged: 6 (D-GATE-R, D-GATE-D, D-GATE-F, D-GATE-I.1, D-GATE-I.2, D-GATE-I.3)
- Test baseline on `main`: 987 passed / 2 skipped, mypy --strict clean (99 files), `tools.lints --all` exit 0

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 13.1 inserted after Phase 13: External-Consumer Examples (MCP Egress): independent-harness agents consume CCF via MCP, zero client-side CCF imports — primary adoption path, demonstrated not asserted (Dave, 2026-08-02) (URGENT)
- Phase 13.2 inserted after Phase 13: external-example-hardening — post-execution cross-AI review re-checks for 13.1 (fixtures vs live SDK traffic, LLM tool-surface narrowing, byte-path probe, clean-runner install, .mcp.json verification) (URGENT)
- Phase 13.3 inserted after Phase 13: Review-Residual Hardening (URGENT)
- Phase 15.2 inserted after Phase 15.1: Substrate adapters and query pushdown; tiers 1+2 in scope, tier 3 designed-for
- Phase 16 edited 2026-08-09: status, goal, requirements, success_criteria — scope expanded to four sections (Phase 16 ships 1–3, Section 4 → Phase 17) per 16-CONTEXT.md D-01..D-12; ten Success Criteria added where the entry previously had none

### Decisions

- CLAUDE.md is canonical; GSD phases map 1:1 to R/D/F/I (I sliced into I.1–I.5)
- Monorepo at `github.com/drcastillo/ccf_code` (provisional D-IMPL-10)
- Phase branches per CLAUDE.md §2.2 (`phase-r`, `phase-d`, `phase-f`, `phase-i1`..`phase-i5`); merge to `main` only at D-GATE
- Model mandates: Fable 5 high effort (Phases 1–3 / R, D, F); Opus 5 or Opus 4.8 high effort (Phases 4–8 / I)
- [Phase 02]: Entry ownership: single primary owner per INV key from pillar mapping; dual-pillar entries get See-also, never two owners
- [Phase 02]: Phase 2 planning docs carried from phase-r onto phase-d (Rule 3 — required for plan execution; planning metadata only)
- [Phase 02]: Batch 1 rulings (Dave, 2026-07-25, all AS RECOMMENDED): D-IMPL-01 Python 3.12+ sole target; 02 GraphStore Protocol + Postgres/SQLite; 03 SimilarityIndex + sqlite-vec; 04 ccf + ccf-runtime packages, async-first runtime/sync core; 05 multi-tenant first-class; 07 EmbedderProtocol; 08 Pattern-5 stage Protocols + reference pipeline; 09 LLMClientProtocol + Anthropic Citations adapter; 33 SignalEnvelope superset; 34 six-semantics storage Protocol w/ reader-writer split; 35 EntityResolutionStrategy Protocol; 37 boot-time register(); 38 OperatorParameterSet, no silent defaults; 39 MAX_TTL per class in Control Plane; 40 CAR scale/thresholds in Control Plane; 41 four-layer single-writer stack
- [Phase 02]: Batch 3 rulings (Dave, 2026-07-25, zero provisionals — marathon complete 49/49): 18 AS RECOMMENDED — D-IMPL-26 hybrid content-hash + versioned-URI addressing; 06 logical snapshots + touched-substate manifests; 17 in-SDK Workflow primitive + OrchestrationProtocol w/ LangGraph two-seam disambiguation; 20 HITLTransportProtocol typed queue, MCP primary + webhook notify-only; 27 substrate split by mutability; 36 deterministic intermediate cache; 44 ReHydrationRecipe + ColdSourceArchiveProtocol; 50 SDK-shipped fidelity lifecycle; 18 workflow state at Control Plane; 21 HumanPrincipalBinding via IdentityProvider family; 22 noun-verb CLI; 23 minimal HTTP skeleton, no L1 endpoint; 43 default human-gated closed loop; 30 nine contract elements, "eight" refs annotated as drift (incl. CLAUDE.md §5, per Dave's ruling); 31 two TTL granularities w/ derivation rule; 32 TrustScorer Protocol conjunctive; 42 prose taxonomy enum canonical; 48 Supervision Quality out of v0 scope. D-IMPL-47 REFINED: DebtFactorScorer Protocol + reference F/C/S computations PLUS evolvability — versioned scorers (scorer_id, scorer_version), Control-Plane-updatable class bindings, per-class custom override, replay pins scorer version in force. Full 12-member Phase I gate list RESOLVED
- [Phase 02]: Batch 2 rulings (Dave, 2026-07-25, zero provisionals): 13 AS RECOMMENDED — D-IMPL-28 YAML artifacts + Pydantic v2 schemas + Jinja2 prompt URIs; 11 single Agent class + Protocol-typed archetype bundles, no user subclassing; 14 LF A2A default WireProtocol + typed-HTTP fallback; 12 dynamic Control Plane skill catalog, four skill types; 19 ordered archetype composition w/ explicit conflict rules; 25 three seams mandatory, effects:unsupported = conformance-verified absence; 29 two-tier skilling governance; 13 five MCP edges via one client lib + egress server + separate ArtifactStore contract; 15 IdentityProvider Protocol, mTLS + detached JWS; 16 verify every inbound A2A product, no fast path; 45 TraceCorrelationHook + ExternalTraceProviderProtocol; 46 PassageCitationProvider Protocol. D-IMPL-24 DAVE'S OWN RULING: all three harnesses (Google ADK + Claude Agent SDK + LangGraph) ship v0 reference adapters. D-IMPL-49 REFINED: deterministic (perspective, product_class, selection_params) signature + DESIGN.md obligation to document swarm intent decomposition as orchestration-layer, named post-v0 extension

- [Phase 02]: DESIGN.md Appendix A granularity: subsection-level for §2A/§2B/§3/§6, chapter-level for §4/§5/§7; Appendix C (D-IMPL ruling index, 50 rulings) added so decision-log linkage is mechanically checkable
- [Phase 02]: D-GATE-D logged 2026-07-25 (approver Dave, zero provisionals; 5 blocking findings fixed in-phase, 7 advisory carried to Phase F); phase-d merged to main --no-ff — Phase F unblocked
- [Phase 04]: D-IMPL-52 logged (Dave, 2026-07-25): v0 examples suite is a horizontal mix of domains; example 00 + the I.1 slice fixtures are banking — replaces CLAUDE.md §9's single-neutral-domain rule (§9 amended in 04-01)
- [Phase 04]: D-12 scope amendment recorded on ROADMAP Phase 4 criterion 4 — I.1 ships ArtifactStore Protocol + file-backed dev impl only; the MCP-backed reference impl was added to Phase 6 success criteria so the deferral has a receiving deliverable
- [Phase 04]: Packaging shape — one v0 distribution ships both `ccf` (src layout) and `ccf_runtime` via `packages.find where = ["src","runtime"]`; chromadb confined to the `chroma` extra, never a core dep
- [Phase 04]: CI lint job is intentionally red on `phase-i1` until plan 04-02 lands `tools/lints` — D-07 forbids making the step non-blocking to hide the gap
- [Phase 04]: Assumption A1 resolved empirically — mypy 2.3.0 `--strict` flag surface is unchanged from the 1.x expectation
- [Phase 04]: Single-writer keyed on graph identity (database path), not one-boot-per-process — the invariant is one writer per graph; a process singleton would forbid multi-fabric hosting
- [Phase 04]: Operators are pure GraphView -> GraphView functions; the engine performs the single as-of read, so no state exists underneath an operator that could diverge between two composition orderings
- [Phase 04]: The engine records operators_invoked from execution, never from the plan's declaration — the L6 lineage strict-equality gate compares two independently produced sets or it compares nothing
- [Phase 04]: MAX_TTL is resolved from the Control Plane twice (product-class registration and gate time); no TTL number exists in /src (D-IMPL-39)
- [Phase 04]: Gate refusals are returned values; exceptions are reserved for broken deployments, so a bad product and a broken fabric are never reported the same way
- [Phase 04]: serve() is one expression because the replay append returns the delivery capability — there is no branch that reaches delivery without a recorded decision
- [Phase 04]: Similarity scores are integer percent; the canonical serializer refuses floats, so a float score could never enter a provenance chain replay compares byte for byte
- [Phase 04]: canonical.py normalizes models field-by-field rather than via model_dump() — dumping rebuilds set-valued fields as sets of dicts, making every claim in the fabric unhashable
- [Phase 04]: Every backend's GraphWriter class lives in ccf.graph._writer, never beside its reader — otherwise the CINV-02 lint guards a module while the real write path lives unguarded
- [Phase 04]: claim_id excludes lineage and observed_at — corroboration accumulates instead of manufacturing supersessions, and a claim stays addressable while its evidence grows
- [Phase 05]: D-05 content comparison uses version-normalized fingerprint (artifact_version blanked) so a bump alone never reads as a content change
- [Phase 05]: delegation_chain defaults to single-element NO_AGENT_DEFINITION chain; build_replay_record passes single-element originating-principal chain (I.2)
- [Phase 05]: Factory resolves ccf-artifact:// refs via Control Plane key {tenant}/{class}/{name}, matching URI version against each registered version's declared artifact_version/semver (content hashes also accepted); reads through Control Plane resolution only, never raw storage
- [Phase 05]: Agent seam failures (ConsumptionRefused, SkillNotBound, AgentConstructionError) are typed exceptions, not returned refusals — broken wiring, not expected artifact outcomes (I.1 refusal-vs-exception line)
- [Phase 05]: SkillCatalog stores only a key index; the registry stays the single source of skill entry content — discovery/resolution read the same audited versions as every Control Plane consumer (05-05)
- [Phase 05]: Skill bindings are pure descriptors in 05-05 (D-08) — no transport or resolution code for any of the four types until 05-06 dispatch
- [Phase 05]: build_replay_record gained optional agent_conditioning seam — agent-serialized dimension-4 conditioning recorded verbatim; None keeps I.1 behavior byte for byte (no contract change)
- [Phase 05]: Tier-1 governance envelope reads a `skill_governance` field (typed PolicyRegimeGovernance) from the policy-regime declaration — field name is mechanism schema; permitted scopes and the tier-2 flag are deployment YAML statements (05-06)
- [Phase 05]: Grant transitions audit as new grant_* AuditAction members through the one existing AuditLog — no parallel log type (05-06)
- [Phase 05]: NotYetBound is a typed RuntimeError for mcp/a2a dispatch (build lacks the transport; artifact is fine) — RESEARCH Open Question 2 resolution; tool dispatch returns a ToolInvocation value, the SDK executes no command (05-06)
- [Phase 05]: Agent holds bound_skills by reference to the GrantLedger's live view — grants/revocations take effect at invoke time without touching agent identity; ledger.grant_set_hash() returns the NO_GRANTS sentinel when empty, pure fn stays content_hash(frozenset) (D-07, 05-06)
- [Phase 05]: Gate package (docs/PHASE_I2_GATE.md) follows the I.1 D-17 format; discretionary in-phase choices recorded in the gate doc §4, not as D-IMPL entries; D-GATE-I.2 deliberately NOT logged pending Dave's approval (05-07)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-60 (Dave, 2026-07-29): all three v0 SDKs get real OrchestrationProtocol drivers under `runtime/ccf_runtime/orchestration/<sdk>/` with bidirectional adapter-import ban; D-IMPL-17 cross-referenced, not edited (07-01)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-61 (Dave, 2026-07-30): absent per-node exception ref = propagate-to-terminal — a defined, audited transition to a terminal `failed` state recorded in the trace; validation-error reading declined (let-it-fail stays expressible). Gates 07-04's exception-routing validator (07-01)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-62 (Dave, 2026-07-30): HTTP/CLI HITL action door is submit-only with honest-contract hardening — `HitlActionReceipt` states `submitted` (type-closed) with real queue disposition; MCP in-process resolve-wiring is a ruled asymmetry; auth stays on T-07-24's residual entry (07-14)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-63 (Dave, 2026-07-30): the two D-IMPL-21 identity-binding reference impls are explicit follow-up-phase scope; caller-supplied principal fields are the recorded v0 posture (07-14)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-64 (Dave, 2026-07-30): webhook deferral REJECTED — the notify-only webhook HITL transport ships in v0 (`ccf.hitl.webhook`: injected `WebhookDeliveryProtocol`, typed refusals, no authority surface by construction) (07-14)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-65 (Dave, 2026-07-30): composition-root debt-cascade wiring closes the I.4 gate; NAMED next-phase commitment — the engine will refuse an agent-node handoff with no bound debt assessment (07-14)
- [Phase 07]: fastapi==0.140.0 and httpx==0.28.1 are direct pins with stated reasons; CLI is stdlib argparse (no click/typer); ADK's `fastapi>=0.133` constraint interaction recorded for the gate (07-01)
- [Phase 08]: D-15 executed — `ccf hitl decide` removed tree-wide, `submit` is the one verb; DECISIONS.md entry dated 2026-07-30 (08-02)
- [Phase 08]: HITL HTTP door fails closed on non-TokenGrant grant objects (403 ERROR_INVALID_GRANT, never caller-principal fallback); refusal bodies carry typed `error_code` constants from `http_api/errors.py`, with `ERROR_SIGNED_BINDING_{REQUIRED,INVALID}` reserved for 08-03 (08-02)
- [Phase ?]: 08-03: HitlPolicy artifact (ccf.hitl-policy) with schema-validated signed_binding_required (default false); D-16 refusals typed at the transport and mapped to shared ERROR_SIGNED_BINDING_* constants at both HTTP and MCP doors; R1 closed with was-called assertions
- [Phase 08]: Example 07 store choice is a config artifact (`store.type`) interpreted by one factory seam; file root and MCP endpoint are env-templated so no path or port is committed; the MCP child interprets the same store_mcp.yaml auth block as the client factory, so credentials cannot drift (08-09)
- [Phase ?]: ADK migration taken over suppression: google.adk.workflow.Workflow usable at 2.5.0 (BaseAgent is BaseNode); D-08 allowlist carries the harness Workflow name-collision, allowlist path matching Rule-1-fixed (08-04)
- [Phase 08]: 08-12 — make ci finalized as ci-core + examples (the phase gate command, command-identical to the always-on Actions pipeline, D-10); live legs opt-in via live-legs.yml workflow_dispatch (Ollama model parameterized, default qwen3:0.6b; Anthropic secret-gated fail-fast) per D-11; push of phase-i5 flagged for Dave, not performed
- [Phase 08]: A3 closed with zero adapter change — the discharge test and example 03's Claude leg drive a genuinely SDK-parsed ResultMessage through seam 4; example 03's session runs over the adapter's own seam-1 carrier, and legs/deterministic.py imports all three harness SDKs unconditionally so a missing harness is a failure, not a skip (08-10)
- [Phase 08]: 08-13 — D-GATE-I logged (Dave, 2026-07-31): Phase I approved, v0.1.0 tagged on the main merge commit (358ba0d), push authorized and performed; review disposition X-1 fixed in-phase (composition-coverage row narrowed to the shipped_operators() test registry), C-4 rejected with rationale (README tracks CLAUDE.md mission wording)

### Todos

- Plan Phase 9 (`/gsd:plan-phase 9`) — includes surfacing the six-item D-IMPL ruling batch to Dave (HARD-01)
- Phases 10–14 gated: 10 on the Phase 9 rulings; 11 on the hardened surface + perf-governance ruling; 13 on Phase 10 (parallel to 11/12); 14 on 11+12+13 outputs + docs-toolchain/D-10 rulings

### Blockers

- ~~Phase 4 (Phase I.1) hard-gated on provisional resolution of D-IMPL-01..05, 11, 14, 17, 20, 24, 26, 28~~ — CLEARED 2026-07-25: all 12 gating IDs RESOLVED (batch 3 completed 17, 20, 26)
- Every phase gate requires Dave's approval + `D-GATE-<Phase>` entry; `/gsd-review` passing is necessary, never sufficient

## Session Continuity

Last action: 08-13 complete (2026-07-31) — Phase I gated and v0.1.0
declared: D-GATE-I logged, phase-i5 merged to main --no-ff, v0.1.0 tagged
on the merge commit, main/phase-i5/v0.1.0 pushed to origin per Dave's
authorization. Prior: 08-12 — examples suite
wired into CI per D-10/D-11 (EXAM-09, Task 1 f145f1e): ci.yml always-on
`examples` job (make examples, CCF_REQUIRE_HARNESSES=1, timeout-minutes
20, never continue-on-error) plus new live-legs.yml (workflow_dispatch
examples-live-ollama with parameterized small model; secret-gated
examples-live-anthropic with fail-fast); `make ci` finalized = ci-core +
examples. Full local sweep GREEN (Task 2 evidence-only): lint 0, mypy
clean (156 files), pytest 1339 passed / 0 skipped, all eight examples
exit 0, D-09 README/artifacts contract check 8/8 PASS.

Next action: v0 is declared — milestone complete. Post-v0 backlog:
Homecams-on-SDK rebuild, PyPI motion, perf baselines, replay-explorer /
graph-export CLI ideas. Observe the first Actions runs on origin for the
EXAM-09 observed-evidence record.

**2026-08-05 session resume.** Phase 15 (SDK Ergonomics) is executing at
18/21 plans; waves 1–11 merged to `main` at `5fbb8e0`, handoff saved at
`60a148b`, tree clean, no worktrees. Full checkpoint context — Dave's six
in-execution rulings, the `_register_closure` evidence for 15-19, the two
self-satisfying-assertion defects 15-21's audit must cite, and the
worktree/`.venv` operational notes — lives in
`.planning/phases/15-sdk-ergonomics-the-integration-surface/.continue-here.md`.
Remaining: wave 12 = 15-19 (example 05 workflow-HITL, autonomous),
wave 13 = 15-20 (external 00-hello-context, autonomous), wave 14 = 15-21
(phase close + Criterion 1 audit, **checkpoint — not autonomous**).
Gates green at handoff: 1908 passed/2 skipped, lint 0, typecheck 169 files,
ten examples, docs-strict, schema-headers.

Resume: `/gsd-execute-phase 15`
