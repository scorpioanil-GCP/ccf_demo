# STATE — CCF SDK

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Whitepaper fidelity — every load-bearing primitive in
`docs/CCF_Whitepaper_1-2.md` realized in code with its contracts, invariants,
and composition properties. Priority order: fidelity → general-purposeness →
harness neutrality → adoptability. `/home/parkave/ccf_code/CLAUDE.md` (rev 4)
is canonical for phases, review protocol, invariants, and decision log.

**Current focus:** Phase 07 — phase-i-4-orchestration-hitl-experience

## Current Position

Phase: 07 (phase-i-4-orchestration-hitl-experience) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 14

- **Phase:** 7 of 8 (phase i.4 — orchestration, hitl, experience)
- **Plan:** 07-01 complete (D-IMPL-60/61 recorded, fastapi/httpx pinned); next wave unblocked
- **Status:** Executing Phase 07
- **Branch:** `phase-i4` (created off `main` at 6520b70)

- **Progress:** [█████████░] 85%

**Nothing blocks Phase 7 planning on the decision log.** The 12-item Phase I
gate list is RESOLVED in full (D-GATE-D, 2026-07-25), and D-GATE-I.3 states
explicitly that nothing on the log blocks I.4 — D-IMPL-56 is RESOLVED with its
implementation ruled into this phase, and advisories A3/A7 are advisory. One new
ruling is pending write-up: **D-IMPL-60** (Dave, 2026-07-29) extending
D-IMPL-17's orchestrator seam to all three v0 SDKs — see `07-CONTEXT.md` D-05..D-07.

**Two inherited prerequisites, not notes** (`docs/PHASE_I3_GATE.md` §5):
the `ControlPlaneStateStore.put` audit closure precedes any plan touching that
seam, and the Workflow primitive is built against D-IMPL-17's boundary rather
than by generalizing the LangGraph adapter's `_build_graph` (advisory A7).

## Performance Metrics

- Phases complete and gated: 6/8
- Requirements delivered: 31/46 mapped to gated phases — RSCH-01..04, DSGN-01..04,
  FEAS-01..04, FABR-01..09, CINV-01..04, AGNT-01..03, XPRC-01..03. **CINV-04 is
  partial**: two deferral skips (`hitl-action-capture`, `workflow-trace-capture`)
  remain active and are Phase 7's to flip.

- D-GATE entries logged: 6 (D-GATE-R, D-GATE-D, D-GATE-F, D-GATE-I.1, D-GATE-I.2, D-GATE-I.3)
- Test baseline on `main`: 987 passed / 2 skipped, mypy --strict clean (99 files), `tools.lints --all` exit 0

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- CLAUDE.md is canonical; GSD phases map 1:1 to R/D/F/I (I sliced into I.1–I.5)
- Monorepo at `github.com/drcastillo/ccf_code` (provisional D-IMPL-10)
- Phase branches per CLAUDE.md §2.2 (`phase-r`, `phase-d`, `phase-f`, `phase-i1`..`phase-i5`); merge to `main` only at D-GATE
- Model mandates: Fable 5 high effort (Phases 1–3 / R, D, F); Opus 5 or Opus 4.8 high effort (Phases 4–8 / I)
- [Phase 02]: Entry ownership: single primary owner per INV key from pillar mapping; dual-pillar entries get See-also, never two owners
- [Phase 02]: Phase 2 planning docs carried from phase-r onto phase-d (Rule 3 — required for plan execution; planning metadata only)
- [Phase 02]: Batch 1 rulings (Dave, 2026-07-25, all AS RECOMMENDED): D-IMPL-01 Python 3.12+ sole target; 02 GraphStore Protocol + Postgres/SQLite; 03 SimilarityIndex + sqlite-vec; 04 ccf + ccf-runtime packages, async-first runtime/sync core; 05 multi-tenant first-class; 07 EmbedderProtocol; 08 Pattern-5 stage Protocols + reference pipeline; 09 LLMClientProtocol + Anthropic Citations adapter; 33 SignalEnvelope superset; 34 six-semantics storage Protocol w/ reader-writer split; 35 EntityResolutionStrategy Protocol; 37 boot-time register(); 38 OperatorParameterSet, no silent defaults; 39 MAX_TTL per class in Control Plane; 40 CAR scale/thresholds in Control Plane; 41 four-layer single-writer stack
- [Phase 02]: Batch 3 rulings (Dave, 2026-07-25, zero provisionals — marathon complete 49/49): 18 AS RECOMMENDED — D-IMPL-26 hybrid content-hash + versioned-URI addressing; 06 logical snapshots + touched-substate manifests; 17 in-SDK Workflow primitive + OrchestrationProtocol w/ LangGraph two-seam disambiguation; 20 HITLTransportProtocol typed queue, MCP primary + webhook notify-only; 27 substrate split by mutability; 36 deterministic intermediate cache; 44 ReHydrationRecipe + ColdSourceArchiveProtocol; 50 SDK-shipped fidelity lifecycle; 18 workflow state at Control Plane; 21 HumanPrincipalBinding via IdentityProvider family; 22 noun-verb CLI; 23 minimal HTTP skeleton, no L1 endpoint; 43 default human-gated closed loop; 30 nine contract elements, "eight" refs annotated as drift (incl. CLAUDE.md §5, per Dave's ruling); 31 two TTL granularities w/ derivation rule; 32 TrustScorer Protocol conjunctive; 42 prose taxonomy enum canonical; 48 Supervision Quality out of v0 scope. D-IMPL-47 REFINED: DebtFactorScorer Protocol + reference F/C/S computations PLUS evolvability — versioned scorers (scorer_id, scorer_version), Control-Plane-updatable class bindings, per-class custom override, replay pins scorer version in force. Full 12-member Phase I gate list RESOLVED
- [Phase 02]: Batch 2 rulings (Dave, 2026-07-25, zero provisionals): 13 AS RECOMMENDED — D-IMPL-28 YAML artifacts + Pydantic v2 schemas + Jinja2 prompt URIs; 11 single Agent class + Protocol-typed archetype bundles, no user subclassing; 14 LF A2A default WireProtocol + typed-HTTP fallback; 12 dynamic Control Plane skill catalog, four skill types; 19 ordered archetype composition w/ explicit conflict rules; 25 three seams mandatory, effects:unsupported = conformance-verified absence; 29 two-tier skilling governance; 13 five MCP edges via one client lib + egress server + separate ArtifactStore contract; 15 IdentityProvider Protocol, mTLS + detached JWS; 16 verify every inbound A2A product, no fast path; 45 TraceCorrelationHook + ExternalTraceProviderProtocol; 46 PassageCitationProvider Protocol. D-IMPL-24 DAVE'S OWN RULING: all three harnesses (Google ADK + Claude Agent SDK + LangGraph) ship v0 reference adapters. D-IMPL-49 REFINED: deterministic (perspective, product_class, selection_params) signature + DESIGN.md obligation to document swarm intent decomposition as orchestration-layer, named post-v0 extension

- [Phase 02]: DESIGN.md Appendix A granularity: subsection-level for §2A/§2B/§3/§6, chapter-level for §4/§5/§7; Appendix C (D-IMPL ruling index, 50 rulings) added so decision-log linkage is mechanically checkable
- [Phase 02]: D-GATE-D logged 2026-07-25 (approver Dave, zero provisionals; 5 blocking findings fixed in-phase, 7 advisory carried to Phase F); phase-d merged to main --no-ff — Phase F unblocked
- [Phase 04]: D-IMPL-52 logged (Dave, 2026-07-25): v0 examples suite is a horizontal mix of domains; example 00 + the I.1 slice fixtures are banking — replaces CLAUDE.md §9's single-neutral-domain rule (§9 amended in 04-01)
- [Phase 04]: D-12 scope amendment recorded on ROADMAP Phase 4 criterion 4 — I.1 ships ArtifactStore Protocol + file-backed dev impl only; the MCP-backed reference impl was added to Phase 6 success criteria so the deferral has a receiving deliverable
- [Phase 04]: Packaging shape — one v0 distribution ships both `ccf` (src layout) and `ccf_runtime` via `packages.find where = ["src","runtime"]`; chromadb confined to the `chroma` extra, never a core dep
- [Phase 04]: CI lint job is intentionally red on `phase-i1` until plan 04-02 lands `tools/lints` — D-07 forbids making the step non-blocking to hide the gap
- [Phase 04]: Assumption A1 resolved empirically — mypy 2.3.0 `--strict` flag surface is unchanged from the 1.x expectation
- [Phase 04]: Single-writer keyed on graph identity (database path), not one-boot-per-process — the invariant is one writer per graph; a process singleton would forbid multi-fabric hosting
- [Phase 04]: Operators are pure GraphView -> GraphView functions; the engine performs the single as-of read, so no state exists underneath an operator that could diverge between two composition orderings
- [Phase 04]: The engine records operators_invoked from execution, never from the plan's declaration — the L6 lineage strict-equality gate compares two independently produced sets or it compares nothing
- [Phase 04]: MAX_TTL is resolved from the Control Plane twice (product-class registration and gate time); no TTL number exists in /src (D-IMPL-39)
- [Phase 04]: Gate refusals are returned values; exceptions are reserved for broken deployments, so a bad product and a broken fabric are never reported the same way
- [Phase 04]: serve() is one expression because the replay append returns the delivery capability — there is no branch that reaches delivery without a recorded decision
- [Phase 04]: Similarity scores are integer percent; the canonical serializer refuses floats, so a float score could never enter a provenance chain replay compares byte for byte
- [Phase 04]: canonical.py normalizes models field-by-field rather than via model_dump() — dumping rebuilds set-valued fields as sets of dicts, making every claim in the fabric unhashable
- [Phase 04]: Every backend's GraphWriter class lives in ccf.graph._writer, never beside its reader — otherwise the CINV-02 lint guards a module while the real write path lives unguarded
- [Phase 04]: claim_id excludes lineage and observed_at — corroboration accumulates instead of manufacturing supersessions, and a claim stays addressable while its evidence grows
- [Phase 05]: D-05 content comparison uses version-normalized fingerprint (artifact_version blanked) so a bump alone never reads as a content change
- [Phase 05]: delegation_chain defaults to single-element NO_AGENT_DEFINITION chain; build_replay_record passes single-element originating-principal chain (I.2)
- [Phase 05]: Factory resolves ccf-artifact:// refs via Control Plane key {tenant}/{class}/{name}, matching URI version against each registered version's declared artifact_version/semver (content hashes also accepted); reads through Control Plane resolution only, never raw storage
- [Phase 05]: Agent seam failures (ConsumptionRefused, SkillNotBound, AgentConstructionError) are typed exceptions, not returned refusals — broken wiring, not expected artifact outcomes (I.1 refusal-vs-exception line)
- [Phase 05]: SkillCatalog stores only a key index; the registry stays the single source of skill entry content — discovery/resolution read the same audited versions as every Control Plane consumer (05-05)
- [Phase 05]: Skill bindings are pure descriptors in 05-05 (D-08) — no transport or resolution code for any of the four types until 05-06 dispatch
- [Phase 05]: build_replay_record gained optional agent_conditioning seam — agent-serialized dimension-4 conditioning recorded verbatim; None keeps I.1 behavior byte for byte (no contract change)
- [Phase 05]: Tier-1 governance envelope reads a `skill_governance` field (typed PolicyRegimeGovernance) from the policy-regime declaration — field name is mechanism schema; permitted scopes and the tier-2 flag are deployment YAML statements (05-06)
- [Phase 05]: Grant transitions audit as new grant_* AuditAction members through the one existing AuditLog — no parallel log type (05-06)
- [Phase 05]: NotYetBound is a typed RuntimeError for mcp/a2a dispatch (build lacks the transport; artifact is fine) — RESEARCH Open Question 2 resolution; tool dispatch returns a ToolInvocation value, the SDK executes no command (05-06)
- [Phase 05]: Agent holds bound_skills by reference to the GrantLedger's live view — grants/revocations take effect at invoke time without touching agent identity; ledger.grant_set_hash() returns the NO_GRANTS sentinel when empty, pure fn stays content_hash(frozenset) (D-07, 05-06)
- [Phase 05]: Gate package (docs/PHASE_I2_GATE.md) follows the I.1 D-17 format; discretionary in-phase choices recorded in the gate doc §4, not as D-IMPL entries; D-GATE-I.2 deliberately NOT logged pending Dave's approval (05-07)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-60 (Dave, 2026-07-29): all three v0 SDKs get real OrchestrationProtocol drivers under `runtime/ccf_runtime/orchestration/<sdk>/` with bidirectional adapter-import ban; D-IMPL-17 cross-referenced, not edited (07-01)
- [Phase 07]: D-IMPL-61 (Dave, 2026-07-30): absent per-node exception ref = propagate-to-terminal — a defined, audited transition to a terminal `failed` state recorded in the trace; validation-error reading declined (let-it-fail stays expressible). Gates 07-04's exception-routing validator (07-01)
- [Phase 07]: fastapi==0.140.0 and httpx==0.28.1 are direct pins with stated reasons; CLI is stdlib argparse (no click/typer); ADK's `fastapi>=0.133` constraint interaction recorded for the gate (07-01)

### Todos

- Plan Phase 1 (`/gsd:plan-phase 1`)
- Verify repo prerequisites per CLAUDE.md §14 (remote, whitepaper present, Homecams readable, directory skeleton, placeholder docs)

### Blockers

- ~~Phase 4 (Phase I.1) hard-gated on provisional resolution of D-IMPL-01..05, 11, 14, 17, 20, 24, 26, 28~~ — CLEARED 2026-07-25: all 12 gating IDs RESOLVED (batch 3 completed 17, 20, 26)
- Every phase gate requires Dave's approval + `D-GATE-<Phase>` entry; `/gsd-review` passing is necessary, never sufficient

## Session Continuity

Last action: 07-14 Tasks 1–2 complete (2026-07-30) on `phase-i4` — gate package
`docs/PHASE_I4_GATE.md` (131746d: sweep 1268/0/0, 16 D-25 rows, verbatim
counterfactuals, deviations register, DESIGN/REQUIREMENTS corrections) and the
§3.1 cross-AI review + triage (386422e: in-phase fixes applied; **four blocking
findings require rulings — D-IMPL-62..65 logged OPEN**, phase stopped per §3.1).

Next action: **CHECKPOINT — awaiting Dave** (07-14 Task 3): rule on D-IMPL-62..65,
then approve/reject the Phase I.4 gate. Only after approval: log D-GATE-I.4 and
merge `phase-i4` to `main` --no-ff. Standing note: `main` is far ahead of
`origin/main`; Dave has not authorized a push.
