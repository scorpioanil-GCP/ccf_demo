"""The concrete graph write handle — layers 3 and 4 of the D-IMPL-41 stack.

DESIGN.md §2A.5.3; whitepaper §7.3 (append-only-with-supersession graph state)
and INV-CH7-10 (only the Assembly worker holds a write handle).

**Why this module is private and why every backend's writer belongs in it.**
The CINV-02 lint restricts imports of ``ccf.graph._writer`` to ``ccf.assembly``
and ``ccf.boot`` — the L2 worker and the composition root, and nothing else.
That restriction is worth exactly as much as the completeness of this module:
if a backend shipped its writer next to its reader, the lint would guard one
module while the actual write path lived somewhere unguarded. So the rule is
structural rather than stylistic — **a new backend adds a writer class here, it
does not add a writer module elsewhere.** :class:`SqliteGraphWriter` and
:class:`PostgresGraphWriter` are that rule honoured: both are here, and both
are the same algorithm.

**One algorithm, two dialects.** :class:`BaseGraphWriter` holds the whole write
semantic — content identity, lineage set-union, chain restitching, tenant-scope
refusal — and a backend contributes only its SQL and its transaction handling.
Two hand-written copies of the supersession restitch would be two chances to
get late-arriving observations wrong, and the conformance suite could only tell
us *that* they disagreed, not which one was right.

The four layers, for the reader who arrives here first (DESIGN.md §2A.5.3):

1. *Interface split* — :class:`ccf.graph.protocols.GraphReader` and
   ``GraphWriter`` are separate Protocols, so a read-path constructor has no
   parameter that could accept a write handle.
2. *DI at boot* — :mod:`ccf.boot` constructs exactly one writer and injects it
   into the Assembly worker only.
3. *Static gate* — this module's import restriction, plus strict mypy, turn a
   write reference outside L2 into a CI failure.
4. *Runtime backstop* — :class:`BootToken`. A writer cannot be constructed
   without one, tokens are single-use, and a second token for the same graph
   raises before any writing can begin.

**Honest residual claim (D-IMPL-41, DESIGN.md §9).** Python cannot make
determined-insider evasion impossible. The claim strength here is exactly: *no
unforced path exists, and every forced path fails CI or fails at boot.*
Absolute prevention is not asserted.

Every statement below is parameterized; no SQL is assembled from f-strings.
Claim content is never updated and no row is ever deleted — the only columns
that change after insert are ``superseded_by`` / ``superseded_at``, which is
what supersession *is* (INV-CH7-04, INV-CH7-21).
