"""SEC-020 — the combined proof Dave set as the row's closure condition. SEC-020 is OPEN.

Dave, 2026-10-07, verbatim: *"prove withheld and nonexistent subjects are
indistinguishable across responses, refusal codes, public references,
composite paths and authorized record reads. Keep SEC-020 open until that
combined proof passes."* This module is that proof, written against public
behavior only; ``tests/products/sec020_worlds.py`` builds the deployments and
the doors. It is the closure gate: SEC-020 may be closed only on a run of this
module with no failure and no ``pending API`` skip.

How to read one test id
-----------------------
``test_withheld_is_indistinguishable[<comparison>-<shape>-<anchor>-<door>-<channel>]``

* ``comparison`` — ``cf``: two deployments identical except whether the data
  source holds the subject, both asked the same question about it by the same
  principal (the subject's own record says it sits in a restricted book, and
  the policy withholds such a subject from the asker); ``same``: one deployment
  whose source holds the subject, asked about it and about an identifier no
  source has ever held (the ``D-IMPL-371`` formulation).
* ``shape`` — the source shape: ``subject_keyed`` (the paved road),
  ``no_acquisition`` (a fabric holding the source before any question),
  ``population`` (an acquisition that reads everything, whatever is asked),
  ``similarity_refreshed`` (a similarity operator over an entity the
  acquisition refreshed), ``composite_subject_child`` /
  ``composite_fixed_child`` (a composite whose child is asked about the
  composite's own subject, or about a fixed one), ``reused_fabric`` (one fabric
  answering a question about the subject and then one about an unheld
  identifier) and ``reused_store`` (one persisted store, a fresh handle per
  question): both expected refused, Dave's Q9.
* ``anchor`` — the class's TTL anchor, ``from_decision`` or
  ``from_entity_freshness``.
* ``door`` — ``in_process``, ``http`` (the shipped API), ``mcp`` (the shipped
  product door; record reads through the artifact server and the Experience
  server's replay-record tool).
* ``channel`` — ``response`` (status and every byte the caller receives but
  the references), ``refusal`` (outcome, kind, reason, key, HTTP status, MCP
  error flag, and the cause the fabric RECORDED), ``reference`` (every
  reference the caller receives), ``composite`` (a composite's child rows as
  recorded), ``record`` (what the owner, and another principal of the same
  tenant, read back through every governed read path).

A failure names the differing paths. Each comparison carries a noise floor —
a second, independent copy of the nonexistent side — and a path that differs
there too is not counted (it is reported). Every channel has an instrument
(``test_the_instrument_sees_a_difference``): a side that must differ from the
nonexistent one, or the comparison could not see what it claims to compare.

Cells that need a public knob that does not exist yet are SKIPPED with the
reason ``pending API: <name>``; they run unchanged once the knob exists under
its documented name. Never xfail, never pass.

Every domain value is fixture vocabulary (CINV-01, CLAUDE.md §11).
